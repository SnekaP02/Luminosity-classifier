IRM-37xxT SERIES 
The Notice of Application: 
Transmission of remote control signal consist of four parts: Encode Part, IR Transmitter Source, 
IRM device, Decode Part 
 
1. When IRM-37xxT SERIES code select frequency, it need to well understand the center system of 
encode part. 
2. Strong or weak light of IR Transmitter can affect distance of transmission. 
3. When using IRM-37xxT SERIES device, it requires the composition of code pattern to reach the 
demand as follows:    
Minimum tburst 
( number of pulses per burst) 
Minimum tburst_gap 
( number of pulses 
between two burst) 
Minimum tpause 
10 pulses 
14 pulses 
25 msec 
 
4. It needs to ensure the translation range of decode part if it is applied to the pulse-width range. 
 
If the above items hardly assure of its application, it’ll cause NG(no good) message from the edge 
of signal.

Notes 
 
1. 
Lead Forming 
 
During lead formation, the leads should be bent at a point at least 3mm from the base of the epoxy bulb. 
 
Lead forming should be done before soldering. 
 
Avoid stressing the LED package during leads forming. The stress to the base may damage the LED’s characteristics or it 
may break the LEDs. 
 
Cut the LED lead frames at room temperature. Cutting the lead frames at high temperatures may cause failure of the LEDs. 
 
When mounting the LEDs onto a PCB, the PCB holes must be aligned exactly with the lead position of the LED. If the LEDs 
are mounted with stress at the leads, it causes deterioration of the epoxy resin and this will degrade the LEDs. 
2. 
Storage 
 
The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 70%RH or less after being shipped from Everlight and the storage life limits 
are 3 months. If the LEDs are stored for 3 months or more, they can be stored for a year in a sealed container with a 
nitrogen atmosphere and moisture absorbent material. 
 
Please avoid rapid transitions in ambient temperature, especially, in high humidity environments where condensation can 
occur. 
3. 
Soldering 
 
Careful attention should be paid during soldering. When soldering, leave more then 3mm from solder joint to epoxy bulb, 
and soldering beyond the base of the tie bar is recommended. 


 
Avoiding applying any stress to the lead frame while the LEDs are at high temperature particularly when soldering. 
 
Dip and hand soldering should not be done more than one time 
 
 
After soldering the LEDs, the epoxy bulb should be protected from mechanical shock or vibration until the LEDs return to 
room temperature.

 
A rapid-rate process is not recommended for cooling the LEDs down from the peak temperature. 
 
Although the recommended soldering conditions are specified in the above table, dip or hand soldering at the lowest 
possible temperature is desirable for the LEDs. 
 
 
Wave soldering parameter must be set and maintain according to recommended temperature and dwell time in the solder 
wave.  
4. 
Cleaning 
 
When necessary, cleaning should occur only with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature for a duration of no more than 
one minute. Dry at room temperature before use. 
 
Do not clean the LEDs by the ultrasonic. When it is absolutely necessary, the influence of ultrasonic cleaning on the LEDs 
depends on factors such as ultrasonic power and the assembled condition. Ultrasonic cleaning shall be pre-qualified to 
ensure this will not cause damage to the LED 
5. 
Heat Management 
 
Heat management of LEDs must be taken into consideration during the design stage of LED application. The current 
should be de-rated appropriately by referring to the de-rating curve found in each product specification. 
 
The temperature surrounding the LED in the application should be controlled. Please refer to the data sheet de-rating 
curve. 
6. ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) 
 
The products are sensitive to static electricity or surge voltage. ESD can damage a die and its reliability. 
When handling the products, the following measures against electrostatic discharge are strongly 
recommended: 
Eliminating the charge 
Grounded wrist strap, ESD footwear, clothes, and floors 
Grounded workstation equipment and tools 
ESD table/shelf mat made of conductive materials 
 
Proper grounding is required for all devices, equipment, and machinery used in product assembly. 
Surge protection should be considered when designing of commercial products. 
 
If tools or equipment contain insulating materials such as glass or plastic, 
the following measures against electrostatic discharge are strongly recommended: 
Dissipating static charge with conductive materials 
Preventing charge generation with moisture  
Neutralizing the charge with ionizers 
7. 
Directions for use 
 
The LEDs should be operated with forward bias. The driving circuit must be designed so that the LEDs are not subjected 
to forward or reverse voltage while it is off. If reverse voltage is continuously applied to the LEDs, it may cause migration 
resulting in LED damage.

 
A rapid-rate process is not recommended for cooling the LEDs down from the peak temperature. 
 
Although the recommended soldering conditions are specified in the above table, dip or hand soldering at the lowest 
possible temperature is desirable for the LEDs. 
 
 
Wave soldering parameter must be set and maintain according to recommended temperature and dwell time in the solder 
wave.  
4. 
Cleaning 
 
When necessary, cleaning should occur only with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature for a duration of no more than 
one minute. Dry at room temperature before use. 
 
Do not clean the LEDs by the ultrasonic. When it is absolutely necessary, the influence of ultrasonic cleaning on the LEDs 
depends on factors such as ultrasonic power and the assembled condition. Ultrasonic cleaning shall be pre-qualified to 
ensure this will not cause damage to the LED 
5. 
Heat Management 
 
Heat management of LEDs must be taken into consideration during the design stage of LED application. The current 
should be de-rated appropriately by referring to the de-rating curve found in each product specification. 
 
The temperature surrounding the LED in the application should be controlled. Please refer to the data sheet de-rating 
curve. 
6. ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) 
 
The products are sensitive to static electricity or surge voltage. ESD can damage a die and its reliability. 
When handling the products, the following measures against electrostatic discharge are strongly 
recommended: 
Eliminating the charge 
Grounded wrist strap, ESD footwear, clothes, and floors 
Grounded workstation equipment and tools 
ESD table/shelf mat made of conductive materials 
 
Proper grounding is required for all devices, equipment, and machinery used in product assembly. 
Surge protection should be considered when designing of commercial products. 
 
If tools or equipment contain insulating materials such as glass or plastic, 
the following measures against electrostatic discharge are strongly recommended: 
Dissipating static charge with conductive materials 
Preventing charge generation with moisture  
Neutralizing the charge with ionizers 
7. 
Directions for use 
 
The LEDs should be operated with forward bias. The driving circuit must be designed so that the LEDs are not subjected 
to forward or reverse voltage while it is off. If reverse voltage is continuously applied to the LEDs, it may cause migration 
resulting in LED damage.

Notes 
 
1. 
Lead Forming 
 
During lead formation, the leads should be bent at a point at least 3mm from the base of the epoxy bulb. 
 
Lead forming should be done before soldering. 
 
Avoid stressing the LED package during leads forming. The stress to the base may damage the LED’s characteristics or it 
may break the LEDs. 
 
Cut the LED lead frames at room temperature. Cutting the lead frames at high temperatures may cause failure of the LEDs. 
 
When mounting the LEDs onto a PCB, the PCB holes must be aligned exactly with the lead position of the LED. If the LEDs 
are mounted with stress at the leads, it causes deterioration of the epoxy resin and this will degrade the LEDs. 
2. 
Storage 
 
The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 70%RH or less after being shipped from Everlight and the storage life limits 
are 3 months. If the LEDs are stored for 3 months or more, they can be stored for a year in a sealed container with a 
nitrogen atmosphere and moisture absorbent material. 
 
Please avoid rapid transitions in ambient temperature, especially, in high humidity environments where condensation can 
occur. 
3. 
Soldering 
 
Careful attention should be paid during soldering. When soldering, leave more then 3mm from solder joint to epoxy bulb, 
and soldering beyond the base of the tie bar is recommended. 
 
Recommended soldering conditions: 
Hand Soldering

When mounting the LEDs onto a PCB, the PCB holes must be aligned exactly with the lead position of the LED. If the LEDs 
are mounted with stress at the leads, it causes deterioration of the epoxy resin and this will degrade the LEDs. 
2. 
Storage 
 
The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 70%RH or less after being shipped from Everlight and the storage life limits 
are 3 months. If the LEDs are stored for 3 months or more, they can be stored for a year in a sealed container with a 
nitrogen atmosphere and moisture absorbent material. 
 
Please avoid rapid transitions in ambient temperature, especially, in high humidity environments where condensation can 
occur. 
3. 
Soldering 
 
Careful attention should be paid during soldering. When soldering, leave more then 3mm from solder joint to epoxy bulb, 
and soldering beyond the base of the tie bar is recommended. 
 
Recommended soldering conditions:

 
Avoiding applying any stress to the lead frame while the LEDs are at high temperature particularly when soldering. 
 
Dip and hand soldering should not be done more than one time 
 
 
After soldering the LEDs, the epoxy bulb should be protected from mechanical shock or vibration until the LEDs return to 
room temperature. 
 
A rapid-rate process is not recommended for cooling the LEDs down from the peak temperature. 
 
Although the recommended soldering conditions are specified in the above table, dip or hand soldering at the lowest 
possible temperature is desirable for the LEDs.

wave.  
4. 
Cleaning 
 
When necessary, cleaning should occur only with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature for a duration of no more than 
one minute. Dry at room temperature before use. 
 
Do not clean the LEDs by the ultrasonic. When it is absolutely necessary, the influence of ultrasonic cleaning on the LEDs 
depends on factors such as ultrasonic power and the assembled condition. Ultrasonic cleaning shall be pre-qualified to 
ensure this will not cause damage to the LED 
5. 
Heat Management 
 
Heat management of LEDs must be taken into consideration during the design stage of LED application. The current 
should be de-rated appropriately by referring to the de-rating curve found in each product specification. 
 
The temperature surrounding the LED in the application should be controlled. Please refer to the data sheet de-rating 
curve.

Notes 
 
1. 
Lead Forming 
 
During lead formation, the leads should be bent at a point at least 3mm from the base of the epoxy bulb. 
 
Lead forming should be done before soldering. 
 
Avoid stressing the LED package during leads forming. The stress to the base may damage the LED’s characteristics or it 
may break the LEDs. 
 
Cut the LED lead frames at room temperature. Cutting the lead frames at high temperatures may cause failure of the LEDs. 
 
When mounting the LEDs onto a PCB, the PCB holes must be aligned exactly with the lead position of the LED. If the LEDs 
are mounted with stress at the leads, it causes deterioration of the epoxy resin and this will degrade the LEDs. 
2. 
Storage 
 
The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 70%RH or less after being shipped from Everlight and the storage life limits 
are 3 months. If the LEDs are stored for 3 months or more, they can be stored for a year in a sealed container with a 
nitrogen atmosphere and moisture absorbent material. 
 
Please avoid rapid transitions in ambient temperature, especially, in high humidity environments where condensation can 
occur.

Precautions For Use
1. Over-current-proof
Customer must apply resistors for protection, otherwise slight voltage shift will cause big 
current change ( Burn out will happen ).
2. Storage
2.1 Do not open moisture proof bag before the products are ready to use.
2.2 Before opening the package: The LEDs should be kept at 30℃or less and 90%RH or less. 
2.3 After opening the package: The LED's floor life is 1 year under 30℃or less and 60% RH or less .
   If unused LEDs remain, it should be stored in moisture proof packages. 
2.4 If the moisture absorbent material (silica gel) has faded away or the LEDs have exceeded the 
storage time, baking treatment should be performed using the following conditions.
Baking treatment : 60±5℃for 24 hours.
3. Soldering Condition
3.1 Pb-free solder temperature profile 
Pre-heating
150~200°C
60~120sec.
Above 217°C 
60~150sec.
260°C M ax.
10sec. M ax.
6°C/sec.M ax.
Above255°C 
30sec.M ax.
3°C/sec.M ax.
3.2 Reflow soldering should not be done more than two times.
3.3 When soldering, do not put stress on the LEDs during heating.
3.4 After soldering, do not warp the circuit board.
4.Soldering Iron 
       Each terminal is to go to the tip of soldering iron temperature less than 350℃for 3 seconds within once in less 
than the soldering iron capacity 25W. Leave two seconds and more intervals, and do soldering of each terminal. Be careful 
because the damage of the product is often started at the time of the hand solder.
5.Repairing 
       Repair should not be done after the LEDs have been soldered. When repairing is unavoidable, a double-head 
soldering iron should be used (as below figure). It should be confirmed beforehand whether the characteristics of the LEDs 
will or will not be damaged by repairing.

current change ( Burn out will happen ).
2. Storage
2.1 Do not open moisture proof bag before the products are ready to use.
2.2 Before opening the package: The LEDs should be kept at 30℃or less and 90%RH or less. 
2.3 After opening the package: The LED's floor life is 1 year under 30℃or less and 60% RH or less.
If unused LEDs remain, it should be stored in moisture proof packages.
2.4 If the moisture absorbent material (silica gel) has faded away or the LEDs have exceeded the 
storage time, baking treatment should be performed using the following conditions.
Baking treatment : 60±5℃for 24 hours.
3. Soldering Condition
3.1 Pb-free solder temperature profile 
Pre-heating
150~200°C
60~120sec.
Above 217°C 
60~150sec.
260°C M ax.
10sec. M ax.
6°C/sec.M ax.
Above255°C 
30sec.M ax.
3°C/sec.M ax.
3.2 Reflow soldering should not be done more than two times.
3.3 When soldering, do not put stress on the LEDs during heating.
3.4 After soldering, do not warp the circuit board.
4.Soldering Iron 
       Each terminal is to go to the tip of soldering iron temperature less than 350℃for 3 seconds within once in less 
than the soldering iron capacity 25W. Leave two seconds and more intervals, and do soldering of each terminal. Be careful 
because the damage of the product is often started at the time of the hand solder.
5.Repairing 
       Repair should not be done after the LEDs have been soldered. When repairing is unavoidable, a double-head 
soldering iron should be used (as below figure). It should be confirmed beforehand whether the characteristics of the LEDs 
will or will not be damaged by repairing.

REMOTE RELAY MODULES 
XPC series remote relay modules extend beyond the traditional reach of our relay panels and motorized circuit breakers. 
Place them anywhere imaginable, like in the rack, on rigging, behind line arrays, or anywhere equipment is located. 
Each module can be controlled from any RPC, RPRC, NPAC or XPC standalone controller and contains an electrical 
connection, outlets, and an Ethernet port. Integration is simple and straightforward: Connect the module to a power source 
and the network, then plug in the equipment that needs power control. Using LynTec’s IP-based GUI, you can set up and 
customize the control and sequencing for each device.

LynTec Modular Sequencing 
series panels add branch circuit 
sequencing to the main and 
branch circuit breaker functions 
normally found in a Load Center 
or Panelboard.
How they work 
Applies AC to low level, front-end 
electronics... waits for them to 
stabilize... (clicks and pops are 
ignored by un-powered power 
ampliﬁ
 ers)... 
AC is then sequenced to power 
ampliﬁ
 ers to spread high inrush 
currents over time. 
Protects valuable loudspeaker 
systems by delaying turn-on 
until all low level equipment
has stabilized.
LynTec 
Modular Sequencing series Power Panels 
BENEFITS
✔ ONE TOUCH remote power control
• Immediate visual feedback provided by ﬂ
 ashing ON switch.
• Light stays ON to verify sequence completion.
• Process is reversed for turn-off sequence.
• May be controlled from one to six locations.
• Multiple sequencing panels may be daisy-chained for  
 larger systems. 
✔ Reduced installation labor
• One wall-mounted, sequenced power panel feeds 
 AC power to all rack and console receptacles.
✔ Low power consumption
• BMB (Bolt-on) and MB (Clip-on) series motorized circuit  
 breakers require no holding current (like DC relays) or  
 heat sinks (like solid state relays). 
• Runs cool — lasts long. 
✔ Automatic load shedding and BROWNOUT protection
• A voltage sensing system automatically sheds the load  
 when AC mains voltage drops below 95 volts for 2 seconds. 
• Capacitor-stored energy zips-off all circuits 2 seconds after 
 
 power fails. 
• The system automatically re-sequences without operator  
 intervention when stable voltage (above 105 volts for 5  
 seconds) resumes.
• Reduces the start-up load for auxiliary power units.
• Smart wake-up is ideal for unatt
 ended systems.
✔ Kill
• Emergency instant shutdown may be triggered by an  
 external contact closure. 
• System automatically re-sequences when contact opens.
✔ HurryOff — Ohh..... no..... switch – Kill without restart
• By holding any OFF switch down for 2 seconds, the operator  
 can trigger an instant shutdown with no automatic restart.

Load Center — Panelboard
What's the difference?
Panelboards are the electrician's 
choice because they have over 250% 
more wiring space. Panelboards are 
used when bolt-on breakers, 200% 
neutrals or high circuit counts with 
heavy isolated technical ground 
wires are required.
Load Centers are typically used 
where the circuit count isn't high. 
They offer the lowest cost.
Load Center
Main Breaker Options
Single Phase Load Center
The standard Single Phase
MSLC 129-xx has a factory installed, 
two pole, ✤ 200 Amp main breaker. 
[22kAIR] (AIR = Amps Interrupt Rating)
Optional main breakers [All 22kAIR]
125A .... -M1125
150A .... -M1150 (25 kVA transformer)
175A .... -M1175.
✧Smaller main sizes are also available 
by replacing the large block type main 
breaker with a bracket-retained, clip-on, 
back-fed, 2 pole, main breaker.
[All 10kAIR Amps Interrupt Rating] 
30A ...... -M1030 (5 kVA transformer)
40A ...... -M1040 (7.5 kVA)
60A ...... -M1060 (10 kVA)
80A ...... -M1080 (15 kVA)
✧Note This modiﬁ
 cation reduces the 
number of available branch breaker 
spaces from 29 to 27, hence a
MSLC 129-xx becomes a MSLC 127-xx.
Small 3 Phase Load Center
The standard MSLC 326-xx has a bracket-
retained, clip-on, back-fed, 3 pole, 100 Amp 
main breaker.
In some instances a smaller isolation trans-
former feeding the panel requires the use of 
a smaller main breaker.
See ♦ below for optional main breaker sizes 
available.
Large 3 Phase Load Center
The standard MSLC 341-xx has a factory 
installed, 3 pole, 225 Amp main breaker (65 
kVA transformer) [25kAIR Amps Interrupt 
Rating].
Optional main breakers [All 25kAIR]
125A ..... -MQD3125 (36 kVA transformer)
150A ..... -MQD3150 (45 kVA)
175A ..... -MQD3175 (50 kVA)
200A ..... -MQD3200 (60 kVA)
♦ Smaller main sizes are also available by 
replacing the large block type main breaker 
with a bracket-retained, clip-on, back-fed, 3 
pole, main breaker.
❂ 30A & 35A: 10kAIR

✙ 70A .......-M3070 (20 kVA)
✙ 90A .......-M3090 (25 kVA)
✙ 100A .....-M3100 (30 kVA)
Note This modiﬁ
 cation reduces the 
number of available branch breaker spaces
from 41 to 38, hence a
MSLC 341-xx becomes a MSLC 338-xx.
-MLO (Main Lug Only) option:
We only stock MSLC panels with main 
breakers. If your speciﬁ
 cation requires a
-MLO we will provide it at the same price
as the standard panel.

All A.C. power for the sound system shall be supplied from a time sequenced source capable of 
being remote controlled from multiple locations.  
 
A means of visual operator feedback shall provide an indication of the progress of the power turn-
on or turn-off sequence at each control point. 
 
Time between sequence steps shall be adjustable from 1/8 second to 1 second. 
Sequencing shall have a time delay adjustable between the low-level equipment circuits and the 
power amplifier circuits. The delay time shall have a field adjustable range from 1 second to 8 
minutes. 
 
The sequencing system shall be capable of shedding the load within 3 seconds after a power 
failure and automatically re-sequencing when power resumes and remains above 105 volts for 
more than 5 seconds without operator intervention. 
 
The sequencing system shall have brownout protection; monitoring the line voltage and triggering 
an automatic shutdown if the line voltage drops below 95 volts for more than 2 seconds.  
 
The sequencing system shall have emergency shutdown capability triggered by external contacts 
or the sound system operator. 
 
Un-sequenced circuits, as required, shall be supplied from the same A.C. source so that a single 
lever main circuit breaker is dedicated to the sound system.

This page contains UL Tested and Certified series combination ratings for panelboards. These ratings apply to either an integral main located in the 
same enclosure or a remote main located in a separate enclosure.
Suffixes HID, SWD and SWN may also be applied to the applicable branch circuit breakers 
shown above, except suffix SWN may NOT be applied in combination with LC main circuit 
breakers.
Where QO (B) circuit breakers are shown above, QO (B) H, QO (B) VH, and QH (B) circuit  
breakers may also be used.
For shown circuit breakers rated less than this maximum voltage, the indicated short circuit 
current rating also applies, but at the voltage rating of the circuit breaker.
Only 15–30 A circuit breakers may be used when the LC circuit breaker is rated 450, 500 or 
600 A.
Circuit breakers may not be used when the LC circuit breaker is rated 450, 500 or 600 A.
Obsolescent. Contact your nearest Square D/Schneider Electric sales office for replacement 
circuit breaker. One-pole FJ circuit breakers are still available.
Where QO(B) GFI circuit breakers are shown above, QO(B), EPD circuit breakers may also be 
used.

REQUIREMENTS
QO-PL (Plug-on), QOB-PL (Bolt-on) Powerlink® Remotely
Operated Circuit Breakers
(Use in Type QO Load Centers and Type NQO, NQOB, and NQOD Panelboards)
Retain for future use.
POWERLINK® QO(B)-PL Remotely Operated Circuit Breakers
require a power supply capable of delivering at least two amperes at
24 Vdc for a minimum of 50 milliseconds. One-, two-, and three-pole
circuit breakers all have one internal motor, and power requirements
are the same regardless of the number of poles and ampere ratings.
The required power supply ampacity and control device contact rating
are determined by the number of circuit breakers to be switched
simultaneously (i.e., four circuit breakers switched simultaneously
require a power supply and a control device contact rated 8 amperes
minimum). The control device may be either a normally-open (NO)/
normally-closed (NC) contact; a single-pole, double-throw switch
(SPDT); or other three-wire control device.
Remotely Operated Circuit Requirements
DANGER
HAZARD OF ELECTRIC SHOCK, BURN,
OR EXPLOSION.
When servicing a branch circuit fed by a
remotely operated circuit breaker, move
handle of remotely operated circuit breaker
to OFF position. Do not rely on remote
operation to open circuit breaker.
Failure to follow these instructions will
result in personal injury or death.
Turn off all power supplying this equipment before working on or inside
equipment.
Before installing circuit breaker turn circuit breaker handle to OFF
position.
Remove panelboard cover and deadfront. Verify power is off with
voltage meter before proceeding.

 3.
Installation of circuit breaker into panelboard/load center (refer to
figure below)
CIRCUIT BREAKER
INSTALLATION
HAZARD OF ELECTRIC SHOCK,
EXPLOSION, OR ARC FLASH
• Apply appropriate personal protective
  equipment (PPE) and follow safe electrical
  work practices. See NFPA 70E.
• This equipment must be installed and
  serviced only by qualified electrical
  personnel.
• Turn off all power supplying this equipment
  before working on or inside equipment.
• Always use a properly rated voltage
  sensing device to confirm power is off.
• Replace all devices, doors, and covers
  before turning on power to this equipment.
Failure to follow these instructions will
result in death, or serious injury.
DANGER
Connection of remotely operated circuit (refer to the figure on next page)
Assure that power supply and control device meet requirements listed
under ""Remotely Operated Circuit Requirements.""
 5.
Except for remotely operated connections, QO(B)-PL remotely
operated circuit breakers are installed in a panelboard/load center
the same as conventional QO(B) circuit breakers.2

Splice Connection
6. 
All wiring and splicing must comply with applicable code requirements 
for Class 1 circuits. Refer to paragraph 373-8 and article 725 of the 
National Electrical Code.
7. Three #18 AWG control wires are attached to the remotely operated 
circuit breaker for connection to the power supply and remote control 
device and should be cut to the required length to reach the splice 
connections. Use #18 AWG or larger conductors with 600 V insulation 
and approved wire connectors for splices.
8. Connect the black lead of the remotely operated circuit breaker to 
the negative (-) terminal of the 24 Vdc power supply. Connect 
the red lead of the remotely operated circuit breaker to the positive 
(+) terminal of the 24 Vdc power supply. Connect the white lead of the 
remote control device. The remote control device provides 
connections between either positive or negative potential of the 
power supply and the white wire of the remotely operated circuit 
breaker, as appropriate.
9. Applying the positive potential of the power supply to the white wire 
(contact closure between the red wire and white wire) will operate the 
remote mechanism of the circuit breaker to the OFF position. Applying 
the negative potential of the power supply to the white wire (contact 
closure between the black wire and the white wire) will operate the 
remote mechanism of the circuit breaker to the ON position. A control 
circuit utilizing a normally open (NO)/normally closed (NC) contact is 
illustrated below.
NOTE:  The remote mechanism will not move the circuit breaker handle. 
Also, the remote mechanism cannot turn power ON when the circuit breaker 
is tripped (VISI-TRIP® flag indicator showing) or when the circuit breaker 
handle is in the OFF position.
Installation of the trim and operational checks
10. Remove corresponding twist-out from panelboard trim and replace trim.
11. Turn power to panelboard on.
12. Turn remotely operated circuit breaker handle to the ON position.
13. Turn power to the remotely operated circuit on and test this circuit, 
turning remotely operated circuit breaker off remotely, then on 
remotely. If power to remote controlled circuit breaker load does not 
switch off and on, turn off power to remotely operated circuit and 
panelboard and check wiring.
NOTE:  A power supply is available from Square D Company, Cat. No. 
QOPLPS (plug-on) or QOBPLPS (bolt-on).
HAZARD OF CIRCUIT BREAKER DAMAGE.
Connect the 24 Vdc remote control wiring as 
shown on this page.
Failure to follow these instructions can 
permanently damage the remotely 
operated circuit breaker.

Built-in Kill, Hurry-Off and ZipOff (PANIC) switch option
for MSLC and MSP and PDS-8EK series AC SEQUENCING SYSTEMS
What the functions do
Kill — EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN
Provides an IMMEDIATE shut down method for the
sound system at the command of a fire alarm,
emergency announcement system, or ZipOff switch.
Optional ZipOff switch, ZOS-5K
Provides a full AC Power shutdown within 250 milli-
seconds after the ZipOff button is pushed.
In case of a runaway oscillation or other unexpected
signal which could damage the loudspeakers if
sustained...
Lift the protective cover and press the ZipOff button...
it latches down and lights red. The AC power se-
quencing system immediately zips off.
Press again to unlatch... the light goes out and the
sequencer restarts to repower the system.
or
Use the new Hurry-Off function at any OFF switch.
Hurry-Off
The MS-12 Modular & PDS-8EK Sequencing boards
have a new Hurry-Off function. If you hold down any
OFF switch for two seconds, a ""Kill without restore""
function is triggered. The system shuts down within 250
milliseconds and doesn't restart until you give it a new
ON command. Kinda like a DSP undo command.
How they work
All LynTec sequencing systems have the ZipOff load
shedding feature. The older SLC, SP and PDS-8's
implemented it by interrupting 24v ac power.
The newer Modular sequencers, the MSLC and MSP
series and the PDS-8EK, load shed when power fails,
but also have a Kill function that is triggered by ground-
ing the Kill line.
The red Kill LED, adjacent to the Kill terminal on the
board, lights and Zip-Off is immediate. The kill line is a
low current line. Long control wiring may be used without
concern for loop resistances up to 32Ω. (22 gauge, up to
a 1,000 ft. run [2,000 ft. loop] or a 680 ft. run of 24 ga).
The ON/OFF latching pilot relay remembers that the
sequencer was ON.  When the Kill line is opened, the
ON sequence repeats, bringing the AC power back on.
For the Modular series control boards the ZipOff switch
connects the Kill line to common, through the Zip-Off
switch's LED, initiating the Kill function.

MULTI-BOARD SHUNT R
The Kill line is an 11 ma. current source from each MS-12 Modular
Sequencer or PDS-8 EK board
A voltage sensor on the Kill line determines the Kill threshold.
The Kill line has an open circuit voltage of 28 volts which must be pulled
down to less than 10.5 volts to generate a Kill function. Grounding the Kill
line to Common will always kill the system instantly. This current source may
also be used to light the Zip-Off switch's, red LED.
The red ZipOff LED only requires 10 ma.  For systems where multiple-board
system's Kill lines are paralleled, a 9 v. voltage regulator chip is installed in
the ZOS-5K which will automatically shunt the excess source current of up
to 5 boards.  For more than 5 boards an additional resistor must be used in
parallel with the ZipOff switch LED. To prevent damage due to overheating
the voltage regulator chip, the resistor should be installed as shown with full
length leads to get the heat source away from the switch.

‡  CE approved units for 220–230V utilize a 220V heating system; 230–240V CE units utilize a 
   240V heating system.  
🍁 Require a NEMA 5-20P cord for Canada.
NOTE: GRAL and GRAHL models that have multiple voltages listed, such as 120/208 or 120/240 
have multiple circuits. For example, a 120/208V unit utilizes 120V for the light circuit and 208V for 
the heat circuit(s). Consult the electrical diagram supplied with the unit for specific information.
CAUTION: Strip heaters equipped with incandescent lights that require a circuit breaker larger than 
20 amps for the heat element must have a separate circuit breaker for the incandescent lights that 
is 20 amps or less.

measurement of its appearance. The lower the “Kelvin” temperature 
the “warmer” the light, the higher the “Kelvin” temperature the “cooler” 
the light.  A typical halogen MR16 lamp runs from 2800K to 3100K.

BUMBLEBEE
The Bumblebee headlight module delivers an even,
streak-free light pattern that greatly improves the driver’s
vision. This ECE-approved headlight module comes in
high beam and low beam versions, specifically designed
and optimized for heavy-duty vehicles. Thanks to the
well-balanced color temperature, the driver will stay alert
longer. The Bumblebee’s exceptional light output in
combination with the long light range places it among the
top of the currently available options on the market.
Not all products are available in all markets. During continuous improvement specifications and design are changing. All values are nominal values.

CAUTION  
 
When Installing 
Lamps in 
Potentially Corrosive Outdoor 
Environments
LEDtronics suggests that a silicone 
moisture-barrier sealant be used to 
protect the metal-threaded base of the 
LED bulb.
Sealant is highly recommended for 
all outdoor-environment LED bulb 
installations to prevent water and/
or moisture incursion that can lead 
to premature degradation of the bulb 
base and eventual bulb failure. This is 
especially recommended for LED 
bulb installations near saltwater 
bodies.
Dow Corning Molykote® 111 Valve 
Lubricant and Sealant is a high-
temperature, moisture-resistant, silicone 
grease. If liberally applied to the clean 
surface of the lamp socket and the base 
of the lamp itself, it will provide moisture 
and corrosion resistance.
White LED technology
is patent protected in the 
United States.
LEDtronics white LED 
products are covered
under these patents.

BPS
Button Panel Station
The Pharos BPS (Button Panel Station) is a versatile 
8-button station with integrated button LEDs 
that works with any Pharos Designer Controller. 
The stylish BPS is available in a range of finishes 
and there are two variants for compatibility with 
either US or UK back boxes. Install is easy and 
convenient as the BPS only requires a single 
Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) network connection.
Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the BPS can be 
placed at any remote location and only needs a single 
Ethernet cable that provides both power and data.
Learning IR
The BPS may be taught to recognise up to 8 different IR 
codes from a standard infrared remote control. When 
one of these keys on the remote control is pressed the 
BPS will treat that as a press on its own button.
Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos 
Designer software – available for Windows or macOS – 
with upload over Ethernet.
Network
Works with any Pharos Designer Controller and links to 
it using standard protocols over an Ethernet network.
Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer 
Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with 
responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is 
a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad 
range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any 
command, to and from any system. Conditional logic 
is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting 
language for unlimited flexibility.
Sleek Design
An embossed magnetic overlay sits within a low-profile 
bezel that is only 5.5mm thick to give a sleek finish with 
no visible fixings. Both the bezel and the overlay are 
available in a variety of colours. There are two variants 
for compatibility with either US or UK back boxes.
Scalable
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or 
more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network 
to build the ideal system for your installation. Each 
Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient 
thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all 
easily programmed using our Designer software.
Buttons
The function of each of the 8 buttons is freely 
programmable and the system can detect press, hold, 
repeat and release events.
LEDs
Each button has a white LED indicator with fully user-
controllable brightness and a choice of visual effects 
such as fades, fast or slow flashing or ramps.

EDN
Isolation
The EDN offers up to 20 DMX512 output ports to control 
your fixtures. Each port is independently galvanically 
isolated up to 2kV, ensuring the control circuitry and 
each port of the EDN is protected against a multitude 
of electrical line faults, including earth potential rise and 
ground loops. 
Protection
The EDN is equipped with “self-healing” DMX ports, 
giving your equipment added protection from incorrect 
setup and energy surges, such as short circuits, power 
induction and AC power faults. Should an energy surge 
occur, it will be contained by the EDN, preventing it from 
flowing into other components; once the external fault 
is cleared, the ports “self-heal”, restoring DMX output 
automatically.
Integration
Built from the ground up on Pharos technology, the 
EDN natively interfaces with the rest of the Pharos 
product range including Pharos Designer software. 
Connecting it to your Designer lighting project is as 
simple as ensuring the EDN is on the same network 
as the Controllers. From there, Designer will detect it, 
giving you full control of your Ethernet network lighting 
solution with minimal effort.
Scalable
Up to 200 EDN units and other Remote Devices can be 
combined with one or more Pharos Designer Controllers 
on the same network to build the ideal system for your 
installation. Each Remote Device is easily addressed 
using a convenient thumb wheel. Whether one 
Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using the 
Designer software.

The Pharos EDN (Ethernet Data Node) is a convenient and scalable solution, providing cost-effective Ethernet-
distributed DMX ports for large control projects. The EDN is an easily configurable networking node that is specifically 
designed to add physical DMX ports to Pharos Designer Controllers and integrates natively with the full Pharos 
Designer range. Extremely compact, it packs up to 20 DMX512 output ports into a 1U 19” form factor. For higher 
port count installations, nodes can be daisy-chained to provide as many physical DMX ports as you need. EDNs are 
discoverable through Pharos Designer software and associated to a Controller to be seamlessly configured as part 
of your patch. Ports can be flexibly assigned to any Designer Controller in your project providing an elegant data 
distribution solution over an Ethernet network with minimal setup required.
RDM Capable (LPC Family, Designer v2.8+)
When connected to a TPC, LPC and LPC X, the EDN 
supports the Remote Device Management protocol 
(ANSI E1.20), allowing fixtures connected to any 
of the DMX512 outputs to communicate back to 
their respectively assigned Controllers over an 

Ethernet network.
SDI
Accessory for the EDN supporting serial data protocol 
outputs for controlling products such as addressable 
LED tape.
Reliable
Solid-state design for 24/7 operation and reliability.
Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly
connectors and easy 19” rack mounting.
Network
Works with any Controller in the Pharos Designer 
range over an Ethernet network. A second network 
port is provided for daisy-chaining EDNs together. 
Our recommended limit of 8 daisy-chained EDNs is to 
ensure high performance; if that number is exceeded, 
some latency could become apparent.

EXT
TPC Extension
The Pharos EXT is an extension for the Pharos 
TPC and together they form a standalone, 
mains-powered 
lighting 
controller 
with 
versatile output and show control options. 
The TPC is a powerful lighting controller with 
Ethernet-based output and integration options. 
However, many DMX and DALI installations 
don’t need the added complexity of network 
infrastructure. The EXT provides local DMX and 
DALI output for the TPC, as well as power and 
other hardware interfaces.
Extend
The EXT is an optional extension for a single Pharos 
TPC. Together they can function as a standalone control 
system, or scale with other Designer devices over a 
network. The EXT supplies power and data to the TPC via 
a single cable, and provides physical interfaces including 
both DMX and DALI.
Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer 
Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with 
responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is 
a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad 
range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any 
command, to and from any system. Conditional logic 
is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting 
language for unlimited flexibility.
DALI Control
Control up to 64 DALI devices from the EXT, with 
support for commissioning with DALI discovery and 
configuration commands. Pharos Designer includes a 
convenient drag-and-drop interface for DALI patching 
and timeline programming. DALI emergency ballasts are 
also supported with the ability to schedule automatic 
Function and Duration tests, automatic querying for 
battery level and lamp hours, and a full test result and 
error reporting web page.
DALI Triggering
Pharos Designer can also integrate with an existing DALI 
installation by listening in to DALI control messages 
sent by another control system or a DALI wall panel and 
using these as triggers for actions within the Pharos 
Designer system.
Serial Data
The EXT has an RS232 serial port, whose data rate 
and format settings (baud, parity, stop bits, etc.) are 
configurable in software.
Flexible Inputs
Each input is individually configurable in one of three 
modes. As a Contact Closure an external volt-free 
switch may be connected across the input. As a Digital 
Input an external voltage source (up to 24V) can be 
connected across the input and thresholds for ‘high’ 
and ‘low’ triggering can be set. As an Analog Input a 
variable external voltage can be measured within a 
configurable range.

RIO A
Remote Input Output Audio
The Pharos RIO A (Remote Input Output Audio) 
device provides a convenient and scalable way 
to add audio integration to your Pharos Designer 
system. The RIO A has an audio input, supporting 
linear timecode or up to 30 band spectrum analysis, 
as well as a MIDI input and output. Each device can 
be placed where it is needed and connected to the 
Controllers over an Ethernet network.
Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer 
Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with 
responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is 
a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad 
range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any 
command, to and from any system. Conditional logic 
is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting 
language for unlimited flexibility.
Audio Response
The stereo balanced line level audio input supports auto 
or manual gain (adjustable in software). The spectrum 
analysis is configurable from 3 to 30 bands on each 
channel, and triggers can be set on the instantaneous 
or peak level of any band or the overall volume. Up to 4 
simultaneous audio inputs are supported with multiple 
RIO A units.
Timecode
The audio input can also be configured to receive 
linear timecode on either channel. The format is 

auto-detected and supported formats are 24fps (film), 
25fps (EBU), 29.97fps (NTSC) & 30fps (SMPTE). MIDI 
Time Code (MTC) can also be received via the MIDI 
Input. A software flywheel with error correction and 
jump support ensures smooth but responsive timecode 
playback. Up to 12 simultaneous Timecode inputs are 
supported with multiple RIO A units.
Scalable
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or 
more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network 
to build the ideal system for your installation. Each 
Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient 
thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all 
easily programmed using our Designer software.
MIDI
Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a 
standard serial protocol commonly used to link 
musical instruments and synthesizers – but it is also 
used for show control and MIDI Time Code. The RIO A 
provides both an input and output on standard 5-pin 
DIN connectors.
Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be 
placed at any remote location and only needs a single 
Ethernet cable that provides both power and data.
Pharos Designer

RIO D
Remote Input Output DALI
The Pharos RIO D (Remote Input Output DALI) 
device provides a convenient and scalable way 
to control DALI fixtures and ballasts from Pharos 
Designer Controllers. Each RIO D supports a single 
DALI bus, which can be used as an output for 
control and as an input for triggering. Each device 
can be placed where it is needed and connected 
to a Pharos Designer Controller over an Ethernet 
network.
DALI Control
Control up to 64 DALI devices from each RIO D, with 
support for commissioning with DALI discovery and 
configuration commands. Pharos Designer includes a 
convenient drag-and-drop interface for DALI patching 
and timeline programming. Multiple RIO D units can 
be used together as part of a single Pharos Designer 
system to provide distributed DALI control over an 
Ethernet network.
Emergency Lighting
DALI Ballasts for emergency lighting have special 
requirements for regular testing, error detection 
and fault reporting. Pharos Designer supports this 
with the ability to schedule automatic Function and 
Duration tests, automatic querying for battery level and 
lamp hours, and a full test result and error reporting 

web page.
Scalable 
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or 
more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network 
to build the ideal system for your installation. Each 
Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient 
thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all 
easily programmed using our Designer software.
DALI Triggering
Pharos Designer can also integrate with an existing DALI 
installation by listening in to DALI control messages 
sent by another control system or a DALI wall panel and 
using these as triggers for actions within the Pharos 
Designer system.
Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer 
Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with 
responsive, reactive software. Designer Trigger is a 
rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad 
range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive 
any command, to and from any system. Conditional 
logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in 
scripting language.
Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be 
placed at any remote location and only needs a single 
Ethernet cable that provides both power and data.

RIO
Remote Input Output
The Pharos RIO 80, 44 and 08 (Remote Input 
Output) devices provide a convenient and scalable 
way to add inputs and outputs to a Pharos Designer 
system for show control and integration. Each device 
can be placed where it is needed and connected 
to the Controllers over an Ethernet network. Each 
RIO has a multi-protocol serial port, supporting 
DMX output, and a combination of multi-functional 
digital/analog inputs and relay outputs.
Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer 
Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with 
responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is 
a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad 
range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any 
command, to and from any system. Conditional logic 
is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting 
language for unlimited flexibility.
Scalable
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one 
or more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same 
network to build the ideal system for your installation. 
Each Remote Device is easily addressed using a 
convenient thumb wheel. Whether one Controller 
or many, it’s all easily programmed using our 

Designer software.
Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos 
Designer software – available for Windows or macOS – 
with upload over Ethernet. 
Multi-Protocol
Every RIO has a multi-protocol serial port, whose 
protocol (RS232 or RS485), data rate and format 
settings (baud, parity, stop bits, etc.) are configurable in 
software. The port can also be configured to output up 
to 96 channels of DMX512.
Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly 
connectors and easy DIN rail mounting.
Flexible Inputs
Each input is individually configurable in one of three 
modes. As a Contact Closure an external volt-free 
switch may be connected across the input. As a Digital 
Input an external voltage source (up to 24V) can be 
connected across the input and thresholds for ‘high’ 
and ‘low’ triggering can be set. As an Analog Input a 
variable external voltage can be measured within a 
configurable range.
Relay Outputs
Our outputs use solid-state relays to ensure silent 
operation and long-term reliability. They are designed 
for low voltage, low current switching (48V, 0.25A) 
and are also fully isolated. Where necessary they 
enable higher currents to be controlled from a Pharos 
Designer system by integration with commonly 
available third-party contactors. 
Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be 
placed at any remote location and only needs a single 
Ethernet cable that provides both power and data. 
Network
Works with any Pharos Designer Controller and links to 
it using standard protocols over an Ethernet network.

The Alyx Sconce is a playful and 
compact piece that embodies the 
ethereal beauty and captivating 
allure of romanesque vault ceilings.
Each arch is a masterpiece of 
geometry and engineering, carefully 
calculated to support the weight of 
the ceiling and roof above. Alyx’s 
delicate tracery of interlocking 
arches and ribs is directly inﬂunced 
by these architectural vaults. The 
gentle radiance and petite size is the 
ideal piece to place in smaller spaces 
or clustered and arranged to ﬁll a 
large space. The shade rests on a 
circular steel backplate, available in 
brushed bronze or satin nickel, which 
creates a cohesive whole between 
the two geometries.

A circle is a symbol that represents 
notions of wholeness, perfection, 
eternity, and timelessness. Our 
Cylinder collection is a simple 
rendition of the purest shape. Despite 
its apparent simplicity, the subtle 
design intricacies make it a more 
engaging piece to examine. As the 
form comes to an end the edge 
gracefully curves inward, drawing 
the eye towards its sleek form as it 
swoops in with effortless ﬂuidity. The 
surface interior is set apart from the 
the exterior with a slightly rougher 
bumpier texture. Although the shape 
symbolizes perfection, imperfection 
in its surface is embraced with a 
wabi-sabi philosophy. The back 
structure of the sconce allows for the 
light to live off the backplate as an 
independent object, while also giving 
it a stable foundation that grounds 
the piece. These details and ideas are 
what come together to form a 
complete product. In essence, the 
cylinder is not just a shape but a 
reminder of beauty in simplicity.

The Ciel collection combines the 
allure of high rise buildings with the 
serene beauty of Japanese lanterns. 
Ciel ﬁnds its form through the 
architectural elements of louvers, 
which allow for the ventilation of air 
to ﬂow in and out. The word Ciel 
directly translates to 'Sky', alluding to 
this idea of lightness, air, and inﬁnity. 
Repetitive lines and form create a 
sharp precision which pushes the 
bounds of our manufacturing 
techniques. The surface texture of 
the engineered polymer give it a 
paper-like feel reminiscent of 
traditional Japanese lanterns. With 
its elongated shape and soft glow 
Ciel creates a sense of calmness and 
tranquility.

ColorBright™ 
The ColorBright™ RGBW Quad Chip LED strip light is an ingenious product 
that has combined two powerful strips into one. Now featuring a 4-in-1 
LED chip that produces both RGB color changing and warm white lighting. 
You no longer have to choose between one type of lighting or the other, we 
have combined them both into one LED chip to offer you the best of both 
worlds while offering a more diffused appearance with its compact chip 
packaging. This product is perfect for those who love to control every 
aspect of their lives, starting with their lights. Choose any color you can 
imagine, including a beautiful warm white.

Strip Light Connectors Installation
NOTE: 
Soldering is the preferred method. If you need further assistance, please download our Solderless Connector Installation 
1. Remove 1/4"" of 3M adhesive 
tape on the back from the end 
of the strip that you want to 
connect. It must be removed to 
allow it to ﬁt properly with the 
solderless connector.
2. Double check the polarity of 
the strip to match the positive (+) 
markings together and negative 
(-) markings together. If you 
accidentally close the connector 
before you’re ready, you can use 
a small flathead screwdriver to 
pry the top back open.
3. Open the top of the grip 
connector and insert the LED 
strip inside. Make sure the LED 
strip is facing up towards the 
translucent top and the solder 
pads are directly above the 
small hooks on the connector. 
4. Once everything is in order, use 
pliers to close and lock the 
connector. You may hear a “click” 
sound when it’s properly closed.

Leona™ Smart Home Door Sensor Product Data Sheet
Note: Before starting the installation process, please use the Micro-USB cable included to fully charge your sensor. A 
blue LED will turn on while charging and turn off when the sensor is fully charged. 
Leona™ Smart App 
1. Before installing your smart sensor on its intended surface, please complete installation of the Leona™ Smart app 
and test your sensor functions prior to mounting. 
2. Go to the Apple Store or Google Play Store and download the Leona™ Smart app. 
3. Once the app is installed, please register an account according to the app wizard. 
4. If you are intending to integrate your sensor or other Leona™ Smart Home products with your Google Home or 
Amazon Alexa smart speaker, please follow the instructions within the app under “Me” to set those up first. This will 
make installing your sensor easier. If you are only planning to use the sensor within the app you can skip this step. 
5. To add your sensor to the Leona™ Smart app click on the “+” symbol in the upper right hand corner on the main 
screen, hold down the “Reset” button on the back of the device for 5 seconds, and follow the prompts to add your 
sensor once the red indicator light on the sensor is blinking. If you have your phone’s Bluetooth enabled it may 
automatically detect the device.
Installation
03
Leona™ Smart Home Door Sensor Product Data Sheet
6. Ensure when making your Wi-Fi connection to the cloud that you are using a 2.4GHz connection as 5GHz will not 
work with this app. 
7. Once your sensor is connected to the app you can setup your sensor to activate your other Leona™ Smart devices 
(Leona™ Smart Plug, Leona™ Smart Outlet, Leona™ Pro Smart Home Controller, etc) by using the pencil mark in the 
upper right corner to access the Automation menu options, or simply use the sensor as an alarm by using the settings 
function in the lower right corner to send notifications to your phone based on sensor status.
8. Once you’ve tested the sensor to ensure that it is functioning correctly with your automation of choice, you can 
move on to installing the sensor where it needs to be. Keep in mind: you can pair this system with third-party smart 
home apps such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa to easily control your devices around the home, thus enhancing 
your smart home experience. 
1. After the Leona™ Smart app has been configured with your sensor, confirm the installation position of where you 
would like to install the sensor. As the sensor itself operates using magnets, do not install near any magnetic fields 
that could interfere with operation. 
2. The two parts of the sensor should be aligned vertically with the small raised plastic lines on the sides lined up. 
Ensure that the sensor pieces are no more than 1/2” apart. The gap between the two pieces should be as small as 
possible to avoid having any false alarms. 
3. Once you’ve determined where you want to place your sensor pieces, stick the 3M adhesive pads to the small 
sensor piece and the large sensor piece’s backer. The large sensor piece has a removable backer on the back so that 
it can be taken down for charging when needed without disturbing the 3M adhesive. 
4. Your sensor is now ready to use, but if the phone app alerts you that the battery is low, please take the sensor down 
and charge it as needed.

MAGRO RGB-W WIRELESS LED WALL SWITCH/CONTROLLER
DATA SHEET
Product Description
 Solid Apollo’s Magro RGB-W Wireless LED Wall Switch/Controller is a powerful low-profile controller that gives you full control 
of your RGB and RGB-W LED fixtures either in your hand as a remote or by directly mounting it on any Standard US Gang box. 
Installation is effortless. Simply screw the unit to any free gang box and it's ready to work. No messy cable connections thanks 
to the included 3V DC durable battery. The Magro RGB/RGB-W Wireless Controller can be used as a hand-held remote or as a 
wall switch/controller. The unit has a magnetically attached faceplate that can be detached as a remote or docked. The Magro 
makes control simple with just five buttons: on, off, RGB brightness control, RGB-color control, and “W” (White) control. This 
unit lets you control W (white) separately in an RGB-W LED fixture, perfect for making a pure uncontaminated white light. In 
addition, the Magro has the ability to remember the last brightness settings in case of a power failure. The Magro synchronizes 
wirelessly with an endless number of controllers (one included) and has an impressive 65-foot range. It produces smooth 
control, pleasant dimming (from 100% to 10%), and a soft on/off thanks to built-in soft ramp up technology. A matching 
white wall-plate is included for a complete set-up of the Magro RGB-W Wireless LED Wall Switch/Controller.

APPLICATION
Tempo’s Dimming Interface Module converts a DALI dimming signal to an Electronic Low Voltage 
(ELV) dimming output via a microprocessor based controller. One DIM-Z-DALI is required per run up 
to a maximum of 600W (120V) or 1,350W (277V).
DIM-Z-DALI does not affect the dimming characteristics of the fixture driver. For example, if using a 
driver that dims to 5% it will still dim to 5% when using the DIM-Z-DALI to convert DALI to ELV signal.
NOTE: 5 year warranty only valid when used with Tempo fixtures.
Limited warranty when used with non-Tempo fixtures. Any testing for compatibility between the 
DIM-Z-DALI and all non-Tempo fixtures is the sole responsibility of the customer. Tempo assumes no 
liability for malfunctions or defects when DIM-Z-DALI is used with fixtures other than Tempo’s. Contact 
Tempo for more information on testing other fixtures with DIM-Z-DALI and lead times for high volume 
orders.

Extended module spacing saves on total wattage and costs. Recommended for applications that allow for extra space between linear 
runs and the wall or background surface. However, every application is different - please consult factory for more information.
Generally a 1:1.5 ratio is recommended to prevent scalloping effects:
1” spacing requires runs to be minimum 1.5” from wall
3” spacing requires runs to be minimum 4.5” from wall

IMPORTANT MOUNTING NOTES
Self-adhesive tape on bottom of C3S-TK-FX track is not intended to be the only means to secure track to substrate; it is an aide to allow the track to be aligned during 
installation. Tempo recommends using a mechanical fastener (small screws, staples, pin nails, etc.) to permanently secure the mounting track prior to attaching 
fixtures. Care must be taken to avoid disfiguring the track where the fixture clips are located, otherwise the fixture clips may not properly attach to track.
Alternative mounting method is with C3S-TK mounting track which is intended to be attached to substrate with small bead of general RTV silicone glue along length 
of track.

Extended module spacing saves on total wattage and costs. Recommended for applications that allow for extra space between linear 
runs and the wall or background surface. However, every application is different - please consult factory for more information.
Generally a 1:1.5 ratio is recommended to prevent scalloping effects:
1” spacing requires runs to be minimum 1.5” from wall
3” spacing requires runs to be minimum 4.5” from wall

WALL GRAZING
10° wall graze optics are specifically designed to highlight rough architectural surfaces and textures such as stone and brick. The narrow optic 
will highlight raised features while creating shadows in recessed features. Do not graze smooth surfaces as the narrow optical distributions are 
not designed for this. Smooth surfaces require wall washing.
Graze fixtures should be mounted at least the set back distances called out in the diagrams above. Some surfaces with deep architectural 
details or textures may require  even greater set back distances. 
Above diagrams also call out the recessed depth which helps hide the fixtures and at same time optimize the consistency of illumination with 
reflective light inside the recessed area. If recessed area is bare wood or metal they tend to reflect the color of the wood or metal onto the 
illuminated surface with bad results.  Therefore white base paint is recommended for interior of recessed area.
WALL WASHING
Wall washing is a lighting effect that eliminates shadows on a wall and enhances the smoothness of a wall. Also used to highlight architectural 
feature such as sculptures, wall hangings, and more. Washing is an easy way to create dramatic effects in any space and also makes the space 
feel larger by emphasizing vertical surfaces.
Set back distances will vary depending on the application and desired optic. The above diagram is general reference only and set back 
distances as much as 4 feet may be required for surfaces above 10 feet high. Aiming is essential part of wall washing and Tempo has multiple 
mounting options for aiming such as the all new 100° rotational mounting bracket (ROT-MTGBRK-C6/C6RX-NA).

INSTALLATION
The heater is designed for recessed installation in 2” x 4” (50
mm x 101 mm) stud or larger wall sections using the back box
provided.  The heater may be wired with standard building wire
(60°C). Refer to “Specifications” and heater nameplate for 
correct supply voltage and wire size.
NOTE: The optimum mounting height for this heater is 18” to 24”
(450 to 600 mm) from floor to bottom of back box. DO NOT
install closer than 12” (305 mm) from the floor.
Mounting Clearances

a. Minimum twelve (12) inches (305 mm) to floor;
b. Minimum twelve (12) inches 
(305 mm) to adjacent walls;
c. Minimum thirty six (36) inches 
(915 mm) to ceiling.
Preparing Heater For Installation
1. Remove the junction box cover / heater assembly from the
back box by removing 8 screws.  Set the screws aside since
they will be used to reattach the heater assembly to the back
box later.
NOTE: The junction box cover / heater assembly consists of two
parts.  The upper part is referred to as the junction box cover.
The lower part is referred to as the heater assembly. (See
Figure 1). 
2. Remove one of the knockouts in the side of the back box
and install appropriate cable clamp (not supplied).
Installation of Back Box in New Construction
NOTE: If the finished wall surface is already up, follow instruc-
tions for “Installation of Back Box in Finished Wall”.
1. In new construction without the finished wall in place, posi-
tion the back box against the side of stud allowing the side to
extend beyond the stud so it will be flush with the finished
wall surface. (You must know the thickness of the finished
wall when installing)  Secure the box to the stud using two
screws (not included) as shown in Figure 2.
2. Run power supply cable through cable clamp (previously
installed) leaving approximately 6 inches (152 mm) of wire
inside box for connections to heater pigtails. Tighten clamp.
TO PREVENT POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO POWER WIRING,
USE ONLY THE KNOCKOUTS PROVIDED IN BACK BOX.
TO PREVENT HAZARD OF FIRE OR ELECTRICAL SHOCK,
DO NOT INSTALL WITHOUT BACK BOX.

3. Attach power supply ground wire to green ground pigtail lead
using appropriate Listed wire nuts or approved connectors.
Push the wires into upper corner of box out of way.
NOTE: If power supply is provided by standard non-metallic
sheathed cable (Romex) and the supply voltage is 240 volts
(two power wires), the white wire color must be changed using
black electrical tape to comply with the NEC.  White is only
allowed for a Neutral conductor.
4. To secure sides of back box not attached to stud, we recom-
mend one of the following methods:
a. When possible, install an additional long screw (such as a
3” wood screw) through the lower side mounting hole into
the nearest stud (see Figure 2). Use care and do not over-
tighten the screw as this will deform the backbox and
make installation of the heater assembly difficult or impos-
sible. Screw should only be tightened enough to keep
screw in place.
b. Drill a small hole in back box flush with the inside surface
of the finished wall and install a screw (length not critical,
but should be at least 1 inch) see Figure 2.
Installation of Back Box in Finished Wall
1. Locate a stud and carefully mark and cut a hole measuring
12-1/4” (311 mm) wide by 17-3/4” (451 mm) high so one side
of hole is along the edge of a stud – see Figure 2.
2. Run power supply cable through cable clamp (previously
installed) leaving approximately 6 inches (152 mm) of wire
inside box for connections to heater pigtails. Tighten clamp.
3. Fit back box into opening aligning sides of box flush with fin-
ished wall surface and secure box to stud using two screws
(not included) as shown in Figure 2.
NOTE: Top flange must extend out from finished wall surface
approximately 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) to allow grill to attach. 
TIP: For proper spacing behind the back box upper flange, a
1/8” thick spacer can be used such as a metal yard stick or 1/8”
thick piece of wood, prior to final attachment of the back box to
the stud. This allows enough space for the grille to fit properly
over the back box flanges. Once back box is secured to the stud
the spacer can be removed.
4. Attach power supply ground wire to green ground pigtail lead
using appropriate Listed wire nuts or approved connectors.
Push the wires into upper corner of box out of way.
NOTE: If power supply is provided by standard non-metallic
cable (Romex) and the supply voltage is 240 volts (two power
wires), the white wire color must be changed using black electri-
cal tape to comply with the NEC.  White is only allowed for a
Neutral conductor.
5. Insert one #8, three inch long wood screw (not provided)
through the free side of the back box not mounted to the
stud and secure in the lower mounting hole. This will prevent
the back box from pull out on the unsupported side when
installing the heater assembly. Be careful not to drive the
wood screw more than 3/8” into the stud. Too much would
cause the back box to pull out of alignment.  See Figure 2.
Installation of Heater Assembly
NOTE: Use the screws provided by the factory, removed in 
step 1 to install heater assembly to the back box.
1. Carefully position the heater assembly, with fan on top, and
element on bottom into the back box. Guide the flange
through the slot openings in the back box.  This will help
guide the heater assembly into position.  
NOTE: The heater assembly must be carefully positioned to
ensure the ribbon connector is not trapped behind the circuit
board.
2. The heater assembly (lower portion) can now be attached to
the back box with 4 screws set aside in step 1
Wiring of Heater
Refer to wiring diagram Figure 3
FOR HEATERS RATED 120 VOLTS:
1. Connect the black (L1) heater pigtail to the black power lead.
2. Connect the white (N) heater pigtail to the white neutral lead.
3. If not already done, connect green heater pigtail to equip-
ment ground wire coming into heater.

ALL HEATERS:
Position junction box cover in place making sure flat ribbon
cable is fitted into elongated slot in cover as shown in Figure 4.
Secure cover in place using the 4 screws provided. 
NOTE: Approximately 3-1/2 inches (89 mm) of ribbon cable
should be extending through the slot for connection to electron-
ics in grille.  Orientation of connector must be as shown in
Figure 4.
Installation of Grille and Ribbon Connector
1. While holding the right side grille in your right hand, extend
the ribbon connector with the free hand and fit the black con-
nector into the black slot located on the back of the electron-
ic control, behind the grille.  The connectors are keyed so it
will fit only one way (Figure 4).
NOTE: Press the connector gently and firmly, but do not force.
2. Once connected, position the grille over heater back box
assembly aligning top of grille with the flanges along top of
back box.  
3. Reach behind the grille and push excess ribbon back into the
slot in the junction box cover to avoid unnecessary bends in
the ribbon.  Lower top of grille so the grille flanges catch the
back box flange and hold it in place.
4. There are two holes in the bottom bezel area of the grille that
align with two holes in the heater assembly. Insert the two
screws in these holes and tighten (Figure 5).  
5. Place the lower bezel in position over the grille and snap
tabs into the corresponding holes making sure it is seated
securely.

INSTRUCTIONS 
D'INSTALLATION
Le radiateur est prévu pour une installation en encastrement dans des
sections murales avec poteaux de 2 x 4” (50 x 101 mm) ou plus, en util-
isant le boîtier arrière fourni. Le radiateur peut être alimenté avec des fils
de bâtiment standard (supportant 60 °C). Référez-vous au tableau
“Spécifications” et à la plaque signalétique du radiateur pour la taille de
fils correcte en fonction de la tension secteur.
REMARQUE : La hauteur de montage optimale de ce radiateur est de
18 à 24” (450 à 600 mm), du sol au bas du boîtier arrière. NE l’installez
PAS plus près du sol que 12” (305 mm).
Positionnement du boîtier arrière dans une 
construction neuve
REMARQUE : Si la finition de surface du mur est déjà faite, suivez les
instructions pour ""Installation du boîtier arrière dans une construction
existante"".
1
.
Placez le boîtier arrière entre deux poteaux muraux adjacents avec
un entraxe de16"" (406 mm), à la hauteur de montage voulue, mais
pas plus près de 12"" (305 mm) du sol ou d’un mur adjacent.
REMARQUE : Si les poteaux muraux sont espacés avec un entraxe de
plus de 16”
, des supports d’encadrement supplémentaires peuvent être
nécessaires.
2. Alignez le boîtier arrière de façon à ce que son bas et ses côtés
soient de niveau avec la surface de la future finition murale (le rebord
supérieur du boîtier arrière doit dépasser d’environ 1/2"" (13 mm) de
cette surface (Vous devez connaître l’épaisseur qu’aura la finition
murale au moment de l’installation).
3. Fixez le boîtier arrière en place avec des vis à bois ou des clous
comme c'est montré en Figure 1
.
4. Tirez un câble secteur dans la zone de l’entrée défoncée à l’angle
supérieur droit du boîtier arrière (Voyez la Figure 1). Tout le câblage
doit être réalisé en conformité avec les normes électriques nationales
et locales. Référez-vous à la partie Spécifications pour le calibre cor-
rect de fils.
5. Enlevez le support de dispositif de coupure M/A en desserrant deux
vis sur le côté droit.
6. Installez un serre-câble dans la pastille défoncée en haut du boîtier
arrière.
7
. Passez le câble secteur au travers du serre-câble, en laissant au
moins 6"" (152 mm) de fils dépasser à l’intérieur du boîtier arrière.
Branchez les fils bleus de câblage du dispositif de coupure M/A sur
les fils d’arrivée du secteur en utilisant des connecteurs de fils (Voyez
le schéma de câblage en Figure 3).
REMARQUE : Si l’alimentation secteur est fournie par du câble standard
à gaine non-métallique (Romex), et que la tension secteur est de 240 ou
208 volts (deux fils), le fil de couleur blanche doit être transformé en 
utilisant un ruban de chatterton noir pour électricien afin de se conformer
aux normes NEC. Le blanc n’est en effet attribué qu’au conducteur 
de Neutre.
8. Branchez le fil de terre du bâtiment sur le boîtier arrière en utilisant la
vis verte située en haut à l’intérieur du boîtier arrière.
9. Fixez en place le dispositif de coupure M/A en serrant ses vis.
Pour éviter un possible départ d’incendie, des blessures corporelles
ou des dommages au radiateur, respectez ces consignes :
1.
Débranchez toute alimentation secteur arrivant au panneau de
service principal avant de câbler ou d’intervenir pour du service.
2. 
Toutes les procédures de câblage et les raccordements doivent
être en conformité avec les normes nationales et locales applica-
bles, et le radiateur doit être relié à la terre.
3. 
Vérifiez que la tension du secteur arrivant au radiateur correspond
bien aux valeurs spécifiées sur sa plaque signalétique.
ATTENTION : ALIMENTER LE RADIATEUR AVEC UNE TENSION
DÉPASSANT LA VALEUR IMPRIMÉE SUR LA PLAQUE SIGNALÉ-
TIQUE ENDOMMAGERA LE RADIATEUR ET ANNULERA SA
GARANTIE, ET CELA PEUT PROVOQUER UN DÉPART D’IN-
CENDIE.
4.
ATTENTION – Température élevée et risque de départ d’incendie,
gardez les cordons électriques, les draperies et textiles d’intérieur,
et d’autres matières combustibles, à au moins 3 pieds (90 cm) de
l’avant du radiateur. N’installez pas le radiateur derrière des portes,
sous des porte-serviettes ou dans une zone où il est susceptible
d’être bloqué par des meubles, des rideaux ou des matériaux de
rangement. L
’air chaud venant du radiateur peut endommager cer-
tains tissus et plastiques.
5.
Pour réduire le risque de départ d’incendie, n’entreposez pas et
n’utilisez pas d’essence ou d’autres produits inflammables sous
forme de liquide ou de vapeurs à proximité du radiateur.
6. 
L
’appareil est prévu pour un montage mural uniquement, avec l’é-
vacuation de l’air vers le bas. NE l’installez PAS au sol, au plafond,
à l’envers (évacuation d’air vers le haut) ou sur un côté.
7
.
Les écartements suivants doivent être respectés :
Du bas du radiateur au plancher - 12” (305 mm).
Des côtés du radiateur à un mur adjacent - 12” (305 mm).
Du haut du radiateur au plafond - 36” (915 mm).
8.
Ne faites pas fonctionner le chauffage sans que sa grille soit en
place.
9. 
N’utilisez pas ce radiateur pour faire sécher de la peinture, du
plâtre. De la sciure ou de la poussière de ponçage de cloison sèche
endommagerait de façon permanente le radiateur, qui doit être tenu
à l’écart.

Personnalisation des réglages du radiateur
Le radiateur comporte trois modes de fonctionnement : Automatique
(chauffage), Ventilation seule, Maintien. Il y a cinq options programma-
bles par l’utilisateur : Thermostat programmable sur 7 jours, Verrouillage
des réglages, Réglage de volume, Affichage en Centigrade ou
Fahrenheit, et Éclairage nocturne.
REMARQUE : Pour les procédures de paramétrage qui suivent, l'af-
fichage va automatiquement sauvegarder le réglage après une pause de
30 secondes et revenir au réglage de fonctionnement précédent. Si cela
se produit, reprenez à la première étape de la procédure.
Programmation du thermostat pour le mode automatique :
Le thermostat programmable sur 7 jours peut être personnalisé pour
deux catégories : Jours ouvrables (Lundi au vendredi) et Fin de semaine
(Samedi et dimanche). Chaque catégorie comporte quatre périodes,
consultez les réglages par défaut qui précèdent comme exemple. Réglez
une heure de départ et une température de consigne pour chacune de
ces périodes :
1.
Touchez et maintenez le contact simultanément avec les boutons
POWER et MODE pendant 1,5 seconde. ""MON through FRI"" va s’af-
ficher avec ""HOUR"" et ""Period 1"". Il s’agit de votre heure de réveil les
jours ouvrables.
2. Touchez une fois le bouton MODE pour commencer la programma-
tion de HOUR pour cette période 1 (Du lundi au vendredi). Touchez
un des boutons UP ou DOWN pour fixer l’heure du moment de
démarrage de la journée (START).
3. Touchez de nouveau le bouton MODE pour programmer MINUTES
du début de la période 1. Touchez un des boutons UP ou DOWN
pour fixer les minutes.
4. Touchez une fois le bouton MODE pour commencer la 
programmation de TEMPERATURE pour cette période 1 (Réveil).
Touchez un des boutons UP ou DOWN pour fixer la consigne de
température au réveil.
5. Touchez de nouveau le bouton MODE pour passer à la période 2, 
et recommencez les étapes de 2 à 4 pour cette période et les 
suivantes. Quand les jours normaux de la semaine sont programmés
(du lundi au vendredi), le fait de toucher de nouveau le bouton
MODE fait passer au paramétrage pour la fin de semaine (samedi et
dimanche). Suivez de nouveau les étapes de 2 à 4 pour paramétrer
les 4 périodes des jours de fin de semaine.
6. Une fois que tout ce paramétrage est fait, touchez une dernière fois
le bouton MODE pour verrouiller ces nouvelles valeurs, ou attendez
30 secondes que l’appareil le fasse automatiquement. Une fois ces
paramètres mémorisés, l’appareil va commencer son fonctionnement
normal.
Mode de maintien (réglage de vacances) :
Le mode HOLD surpasse les réglages programmés, et s’avère 
commode quand une température constante doit être maintenue pour du
confort, ou qu’une consigne de température plus basse est voulue dans
la période où les locaux sont inoccupés longtemps (réglage pour les
vacances), ou que les locaux doivent juste être gardés hors gel dans les
régions froides.
1
.
Touchez une fois le bouton MODE pour activer l’affichage, et
touchez-le de nouveau jusqu’à ce qu’apparaisse l’indicateur HOLD.
2. Touchez un des boutons UP ou DOWN pour fixer la consigne de
température en fonctionnement de maintien (HOLD). Durant cette
période, les réglages par défaut ainsi que la rotation automatique sur
quatre périodes des jours seront désactivés. Le radiateur fonction-
nera à partir du réglage actuel, où le point de consigne peut être
ajusté.
3. Pour sortir du mode de fonctionnement HOLD, l’utilisateur n’aura
qu’à toucher une fois de plus le bouton MODE.
REMARQUE : Le réglage de consigne du mode HOLD ne sera pas con-
servé une fois sorti du mode.
Mode de ventilation :
Ce radiateur comporte aussi l’option de s’utiliser comme appareil à ventila-
tion uniquement. Il n’y aura pas de production de chaleur, mais le ventilateur
va tourner pour fournir une douce brise déplaçant l’air ambiant.
Touchez de nouveau le bouton MODE jusqu’à ce que l’icône FAN s’éclaire
et clignote. 
REMARQUE : L
’icône de ventilateur va clignoter pendant 3 secondes.
Après ces 3secondes, le radiateur va passer en mode de fonction-
nement à ventilation uniquement. Touchez de nouveau le bouton MODE
pour changer le type de fonctionnement de l’appareil.
Indication en Celsius / Fahrenheit :
Par défaut l’unité de température de l’appareil de chauffage est le degré
Fahrenheit. Pour changer d’unité et passer en degrés Celsius, touchez et
maintenez le contact simultanément avec les boutons MODE et DOWN
pendant 1,5 seconde. Notez alors l’éclairage de l’indicateur C (pour
Celsius). Touchez de nouveau ces deux boutons ensemble pour revenir
à l’unité F (Fahrenheit).
Possibilité de verrouillage :
Touchez et maintenez le contact simultanément avec les boutons
POWER et DOWN pendant 1,5 seconde. Notez alors l’éclairage du 
symbole Padlock. Touchez de nouveau ces deux boutons ensemble 
pour désactiver le verrouillage. 
REMARQUE : Quand le symbole de Padlock est activé (ON), l’appareil
est verrouillé (Le bouton POWER reste fonctionnel, mais les fonctions
habituelles des autres boutons sont inaccessibles).
Fonctionnement avec éclairage nocturne :
Touchez et maintenez le contact simultanément avec les boutons MODE
et UP pendant 1,5 seconde. Notez alors l’allumage de l’indicateur
NIGHT LIGHT (ampoule d’éclairage), et le rétro-éclairage va s’activer à
100 % de luminosité. Touchez de nouveau ces deux boutons ensemble
et l’indicateur NIGHT LIGHT ainsi que le rétro-éclairage vont s’éteindre.
21
Contrôle du volume sonore :
Il y a trois niveaux de réglage du bip sonore : 2=FORT, 1=FAIBLE,
0=SOURDINE. Pour régler ce niveau sonore, voici les instructions :
1
. Assurez-vous que l’affichage est bien éteint (OFF).
2. Touchez simultanément les boutons POWER et MODE jusqu’à 
l’affichage de 2, 1 ou 0.
3. Touchez un des boutons UP ou DOWN pour choisir entre 2 (FORT),
1(FAIBLE) ou 0 (ARRÊT).
4. Une fois le volume sonore voulu choisi, touchez ensemble le bouton
POWER et le bouton MODE pour sortir du menu de réglage sonore,
ou ne touchez à rien pendant 30 secondes pour une prise en
compte automatique de votre choix.
Restauration des paramètres d’usine :
L
’affichage doit être éteint, le bouton POWER être de couleur ambre.
Touchez et maintenez le contact simultanément avec les boutons MODE
et DOWN pendant 1,5 seconde, un bip sonore est émis et les valeurs
d’usine sont restaurées. Voyez ""Réglages par défaut pour le mode
automatique"".
Télécommande :
La télécommande va piloter votre radiateur jusqu’à une distance maxi-
male de 20 pieds (6 m) de l’appareil. Pour fonctionner correctement la
télécommande doit être pointée en direction du radiateur sans obstacle.
La télécommande ne sera pas à même de programmer votre radiateur.
Elle ne permettra que de l’activer ou désactiver, et de monter ou de

Install the power supply wire to the heater location and thermostat location as
determined by the thermostat option selected. If the power supply enters through
the knockout in back of the heater, install a cable connector (not included) on the
power supply wire and insert in knockout, leaving 6 (152mm) to 8 inches
(203mm) of wire for heater connection.
8. If the power supply enters the heater through the hole in bottom portion of the
junction box, a cable connector is not required. 
9. Position the heater on the wall and locate wall studs. Drill, punch, or use nail dri-
ver to put holes through the enclosure back (above the element) at stud loca-
tions.
NOTE: The heater enclosure is provided with nail point marks showing correct
locations for mounting holes.
The following methods of mounting the heaters to common types of wall surfaces
are suggested:
a.
Plaster Walls: Use toggle or molly screw anchors.
b.
Wall Studs: Use #12 round head screws penetrating at least 3/4"" (19mm) into
stud.
c.
Masonry Walls: Use #12 round head screws into lead, plastic, or fiber
expansion anchor.
Tighten all screws snugly, then back off 1/2-turn to allow the back panel to
expand and contract.
10. Connect supply wiring to heater as described in Figure 6, or as shown in the
wiring diagrams supplied with the accessory kits intended for use with this 
heater.
11. Secure the desired accessories to baseboard as shown in the accessory instruc
tion sheet, and use the wiring diagram supplied with the accessory.
NOTE: Baseboard heaters must be thermostatically controlled.
12. Replace the front cover by fitting the top lip of the cover onto the tabs on each
junction box and top edge of the element support bracket(s). Rotate the cover 
downward, pushing the bottom corners inward. Install two screws (removed in 
Step 4) through the cover into the junction boxes. See that the bottom of the 
cover is engaged onto the bottom of each element support bracket. See Figure 7

3.
If the power supply is to enter through the end of the heater series so that the
end cap can be installed after the heaters are installed, continue “Installation of
Single Unit”
, Steps 9 through 12.
4.
If the power supply is to feed heaters at the junction box that is adjacent to anoth-
er heater, it is easier for the power supply connections to be made prior to the
installation of the heater(s) to the wall. If this is not possible, connections may be
made through the opening in the junction boxes when the front cover(s) is
removed. See Figure 8.
5.
Connecting power supply cables may be routed from heater to heater by drilling
a 1/2-inch (13mm) diameter hole in the end caps for the heaters that fit together
(See Figure 9).  To prevent possible damage to internal heater wiring, all drilling
of end caps must be done with end caps removed from heater.

Steps 12 and 13.
OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
1.
An integral or remote wall thermostat is recommended for each room. In very
large rooms it is recommended that a low voltage thermostat with double or mul-
tiple circuit relays be used to provide the most comfortable results.

wall location.
2.
After the baseboard system has been completely installed, all thermostats
should be turned to LOW or NO HEAT setting. Then turn on breakers or install
fuses. Wait 3 to 5 minutes and check to see that none of the heaters are operat-
ing. If operating, disconnect power and check wiring. If none are operating then
turn the thermostats to highest setting and wait 3 to 5 minutes. Check to see that
all heaters are operating. Should any not be operating, disconnect power and
check wiring.
3.
Allow entire system to operate steadily for 1/2-hour. For a period of time after the
heaters are put into operation, the owner may notice a “new smell” coming from
the heaters. This is expected on new installations. Bringing heaters to full opera-
tion will eliminate this condition in a short period of time.
4.
Select the setting for comfort on all thermostats.
5.
To clean heater: Because of the convection heating principle which depends
upon circulation of air through the finned element, dust particles will periodically
be deposited between the fins and should be removed occasionally for maxi-
mum efficiency of the heater. A vacuum cleaner with proper attachments can
easily be worked along the top and bottom of the finned element to clear it of
dust deposits.
NOTE: The painted finish of the heater may be cleaned with a slightly damp
cloth if desired. Do not use wax cleaners or polishes as these waxes may
vaporize when the heater is in operation and cause discoloration.

7. Installez les câbles pour l’alimentation du radiateur et le thermostat, selon le type
de thermostat choisi. Si les câbles d’alimentation passent par un disque
défonçable à l’arrière du radiateur, posez un caccord (non fourni) à l’extrémité du
câble et fixez le raccord dans l’ouverture en laissant dépasser une longueur de
câble de 6 à 8 po (152 à 203mm) pour le branchement au radiateur.
8. Si les câbles d’alimentation passent par une ouverture dans le fond de la boîte
de jonction, le raccord de câble est facultatif.
9. Placez le radiateur contre le mur et repérez les poteaux du mur. Percez des trous
dans la paroi arrière du radiateur (au-dessus de l’élément) vis-à-vis des poteaux,
à l’aide d’une perceuse ou d’un emporte-pièce, ou clouez le radiateur à l’aide
d’une cloueuse .
NOTE : Le boîtier du radiateur est marqué aux points de clouage appropriés.
Voici des méthodes suggérées pour la fixation des radiateurs à différents types de
revêtement mural.
a.
Panneaux de plâtre : Utilisez des chevilles élastiques ou des boulons à
ailettes.
b.
Poteaux : Utilisez des vis n° 12 à tête ronde pénétrant d’au moins 3/4 po
(19mm) dans le poteau. 
c.
Maçonnerie : Utilisez des vis n° 12 à tête ronde et des chevilles en plomb, en
plastique ou en fibre.
Serrez les vis à fond puis desserrez-les d’un demi-tour en prévision de la dilata-
tion et de la contraction de la paroi arrière.
10. Branchez le radiateur selon la figure 6 ou selon le schéma de câblage de
l’accessoire destiné à ce radiateur.
11. Fixez les accessoires au radiateur selon le feuillet d’instructions  de l’accessoire 
et suivez les instructions du schéma de câblage de l’accessoire.
NOTE : Les radiateurs électriques doivent être commandés par un thermostat.
12. Reposez le couvercle frontale en accrochant le rebord supérieur sur la patte des 
boîtes de jonction et sur la patte supérieure des supports de l’élément. Pivotezle 
couvercle vers le bas et poussez le bord inférieur vers le radiateur. Posez les vis 
(enlevées à l’étape 4) fixant le couvercle aux boîtes de jonction. Assurez-vous que 
le bord inférieur du couvercle s’emboîte sur la patte inférieure des supports de 
l’élément (voir la figure 7).
13. Reposez les couvercles latéraux au moyen des vis (enlevées à l’étape 3).
INSTALLATION DE RADIATEURS 
EN BATTERIE
1.
Placez les radiateurs en file avec un dégagement de 1/32 po (0,76mm) en prévi-
sion de la dilatation.
2.
Installez chaque radiateur selon les instructions INSTALLATION D’UN RADIA-
TEUR SIMPLE, étapes 1 à 8.
3.
Si le branchement doit être fait à l’extrémité de la file, de sorte que le couvercle latéral
peut être posé après l’installation des radiateurs, poursuivez l’installation selon les
étapes 9 à 12 des instructions INSTALLATION D’UN RADIATEUR SIMPLE.

4.
Si le branchement doit être fait dans une boîte de jonction intermédiaire de la
file, il est plus simple d’effectuer les connexions avant de fixer les radiateurs au
mur. Sîl n’est pas possible de procéder ainsi, on peut effectuer les connexions
par l’ouverture des boîtes de jonction une fois les couvercles frontaux enlevés
(voir la figure 8).
5.
Pour acheminer les câbles raccordant deux radiateurs adjacents, on peut percer un
trou de 1/2 po (12,7mm) de diamètre dans les couvercles latéraux mitoyens (voir la
figure 9).
6.
Raccordez les radiateurs selon le schéma de câblage de la figure 10.
7.
Reposez les couvercles frontaux et latéraux selon les étapes 12 et 13 des
instructions INSTALLATION D’UN RADIATEUR SIMPLE.
INSTRUCTIONS D’EXPLOITATION 
ET DE MAINTENANCE
1.
On recommande un thermostat intégré au radiateur ou mural pour chaque pièce.
Pour les grandes pièces, on recommande un thermostat basse tension et un ou
plusieurs relais pour un confort optimal.

2.
Une fois tous les radiateurs installés, réglez tous les thermostats à la position BAS
ou FROID. Placez les disjoncteurs à la position Marche ou posez les fusibles.
Attendez 3 à 5 min pour vous assurer qu’aucun radiateur n’est sous tension. Si un
radiateur est sous tension, coupez l’alimentation et vérifiez les connexions. Si
aucun radiateur n’est sours tension, réglez les thermostats au maximum et atten-
dez 3 à 5 min. Assurez-vous que tous les radiateurs sont sous tension. S’il y a un
radiateur hors tension, coupez l’alimentation et vérifiez les connexions.
3.
Laissez les radiateurs chauffer de façon continue pendant environ 1/2 h.
Pendant un certain temps après la mise en service d’un radiateur, le propriétaire
peut remarquer que celui-ci dégage une « drôle d’odeur ». Cette odeur est nor-
male dans le cas d’une nouvelle installation et disparaît rapidement si on laisse
les radiateurs chauffer de façon continue.
4.
Réglez tous les thermostats à la température d’ambiance désirée.
5.
Nettoyage du radiateur : Étant donné le principe du chauffage par convexion, le
passge de l’air autour des ailettes de l’élément chauffant dépose avec le temps de
la poussière entre ces dernières. Pour un rendement optimal du radiateur, cette
poussière devrait être enlevée. À cette fin, on recommande de passer un aspira-
teur équipé d’une brosse appropriée le long du dessus et du dessous de l’élément
chauffant.
NOTE : On peut nettoyer au besoin les pièces peintes de ce radiateur à l’aide d’un linge
légèrement humide. N’utilisez pas de produits de nettoyage contenant de la cire ni de pro-
duits à polir car la cire peut s’évaporer lorsque le radiateur chauffe et décolorer la pein-
ture.
UNE FOIS LES CONNEXIONS 
EFFECTUÉES, REPOUSSEZ LES

Si la fuente de alimentación va a suministrar la energía a los calentadores a
través de la caja de conexiones adyacente a otro calentador, es más fácil
realizar las conexiones de la fuente de alimentación antes de instalar el(los)
calentador(es) a la pared.  Si no es posible lo anterior, pueden efectuarse las
conexiones a través de la abertura en las cajas de conexiones al retirarse la(s)
cubierta(s).  Vea la Figura 8.
5.
Los cables de alimentación de los calentadores pueden tenderse de una unidad
a otra si se abre un orificio de 13 mm (1/2 pulg.) en las tapas de los extremos
entre calentadores. Vea la Figura 9.  Para evitar daños al cableado interno del
calentador, las tapas de los extremos deberán sacarse del calentador antes de
perforarlas.

INSTRUCCIONES DE OPERACÓN Y MANTENIMIENTO
1.
Se recomienda el uso de un termostato remoto de pared para cada habitación.
Para habitaciones muy grandes se recomienda usar un termostato de baja ten-
sión con circuitos de relé dobles o múltiples, para obtener resultados óptimos.

aire al abrir una puerta.
• Donde puedan llegarle los 
rayos del sol.
2.
Después de completar la instalación del sistema de zócalo, todos los ter-
mostatos deben ajustarse a la posición baja (LOW) o apagado (NO HEAT).
Luego active los cortacircuitos o instale los fusibles.  Espere de 3 a 5 minutos y
compruebe que ninguno de los calentadores esté operando.  Si hay alguno
operando, desconecte la alimentación y revise el cableado.  Si no hay ninguno 
operando, coloque los termostatos en el ajuste más alto y espere de 3 a 5 min-
utos.  Compruebe que todos los calentadores estén operando.  En caso de
haber alguno que no esté operando, desconecte la alimentación y revise el
cableado.
3.
Deje que todo el sistema opere en forma continua por media hora.  Poco
después de que los calentadores se pongan en operación, sentirá un “nuevo
olor” que proviene de los calentadores.  Esto es normal en las instalaciones
nuevas.  El hacer operar los calentadores en forma continua eliminará esta
condición en un corto tiempo.
4.
Ajuste todos los termostatos a su gusto.
5.
Limpieza de los calentadores: Debido al principio de calentamiento por convec-
ción, el cual depende de la circulación de aire a través de las aletas del ele-
mento radiador, periódicamente se depositarán partículas de polvo entre las ale-
tas.  Dichas partículas de polvo deben eliminarse para obtener el máximo de efi-
ciencia del calentador.  Para este fin puede utilizarse una aspiradora, equipada
con los aditamentos adecuados, pasándola por la parte superior e inferior de las
aletas del elemento radiador para eliminar los depósitos de polvo.
NOTA: Si desea, puede limpiar las superficies pintadas del calentador con un paño lig-
eramente húmedo.  No utilice limpiadores de cera ni pulimentos, ya que las ceras se
pueden vaporizar cuando el calentador esté en operación y producir decoloración.
DESPUÉS DE CONECTAR EL CABLE 
DE ALIMENTACIÓN, INTRODUZCA 
LOS ALAMBRES DENTRO DE LA 
CAJA DE CONEXIONES.

ment.  If built-in cable clamp is not used, install approved
cable restraint (not included ) in desired knockout.
NOTE: cross stamped mounting perforations are provided in
back of heater enclosure above heating element at mounting
screw locations, see Figure 4.  
6. Position heater at desired location and attach to wall using
wood screws or appropriate hardware.  Locate studs and
drive screws into studs where possible.  For heaters up to 6
feet (1.8 m) in length, one screw at each end is adequate.
For longer units, an additional screw in center is required.
Tighten screws and then loosen screws at least ¼ turn to
allow heater to expand and contract during use.  If unit is
mounted above floor, two additional mounting holes are pro-
vided at each end below the heating element (see Figure 4).
Install an additional screw at each end for stability making
sure to loosen each screw at least ¼ turn.
7. Connect the supply cable grounding wire to the bare copper
pigtail in wiring compartment.
8. Follow the desired wiring diagram, as shown in Figure 5, to
connect the power supply to the heater using approved wire
nuts.
NOTE: When accessories are installed, use wiring diagram 
supplied with the accessory.
9. If front cover was removed, reinstall by hooking the top edge
on the support bracket(s).  Then push down to latch onto the
support bracket(s).
10.Replace wiring compartment cover(s).
11.Follow instructions accompanying thermostat for installation
and wiring thermostat.  Visit www.marleymep.com for typical
thermostat wiring diagrams.
OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
1. This heater must be properly installed before it is used.
2. After the baseboard system has been completely installed,
all thermostats should be turned to LOW or NO HEAT.  
Turn on breakers, wait 3 to 5 minutes and check to see that
none of the heaters are operating.  If operating, disconnect
power and check wiring.  If none are operating then turn
thermostats to highest position and wait 3 to 5 minutes.
Check to see that all heater(s) are operating.  Should any not
be operating, disconnect power and check wiring. 
3. Allow entire system to operate steadily for 1/2 hour.  This 
should remove oily residue from manufacturing.  (Some 
smoking may occur).
4. Select the setting for comfort on all thermostats.
5. A safety limit control is provided to turn off the heater auto-
matically if it is blocked or otherwise overheats due to an
abnormal condition-see Figures 4 and 5. DO NOT bypass or
remove this safety device from the electrical circuit-see
Warning 11 on page 2. During normal use, this safety control
should not operate. If you find that this control is operating,
make sure the heater is not being blocked. If it continues to
cycle the heater off, disconnect power to heater and have it
checked and repaired by a qualified electrician.
MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
Your heater will give you years of service and comfort with only
minimum care.  To assure efficient operation follow the simple
instructions below.
1. The user can perform some basic cleaning of the heater.  All
other servicing is to be done by qualified service personnel.
2. Because of the convection heating principle which depends
upon a circulation of air through the finned element, dust will
collect between the fins. The heater should be cleaned regu-
larly for maximum efficiency.  
3. To clean heating element fins, first remove both wiring com-
partment covers and the front cover. Using a vacuum cleaner
or compressed air, remove the dust and lint from the alu-
minum heating element fins while being careful not to dam-
age the fins. 
4. The painted heater cabinet may be cleaned using a slightly
damp cloth. Do not use abrasive cleaners or waxes as these
may damage the finish or leave a residue that will discolor.
5. Replace front cover (making sure it is latched in place at
each element support bracket and at each end) and two
wiring compartment covers (using the two screws provided),
restore power and check heater for proper operation.
Painting
If it becomes necessary to repaint heater, use only a quality
enamel paint suitable for metal surfaces following the instruc-
tions provided with the paint. DO NOT paint the heating element
or safety limit capillary tube. Repaint only the exterior of the 
cabinet. 
1.
Serious injury or death could result from electric shock.
Make sure electrical power supply circuit coming to heater
is disconnected at main disconnect or service panel before
servicing this heater.  Allow heater to cool before cleaning
to prevent a possible burn.
2.
Use care when cleaning element fins to avoiding damaging
fins.  Note also that fins are sharp and may cause cuts so
avoid contact.

transportista.
INSTRUCCIONES DE INSTALACIÓN
Espacios libres mínimos
Del calefactor al piso: el calefactor puede montarse directamente sobre
el piso terminado o, si se desea, por encima del piso (por ejemplo,
sobre el zócalo). Pueden instalarse hasta 19 mm (3/4 pulgada) de
alfombras hasta y alrededor del calefactor, siempre que no se obstruya
la circulación de aire.
Del calefactor a cortinados: no instale el calefactor en un lugar en el que
haya cortinas o cortinados que puedan tomar contacto con él. Vea los
espacios mínimos requeridos en la Fig. 2.
Nota importante: algunas telas y materiales alteran su color o pueden
dañarse por causa del calor. Por eso, evite instalar el calefactor contra
revestimientos de pared vinílicos o debajo de elementos de plástico o
de vinilo como persianas o cortinados vinílicos, dado que éstos pueden
resultar dañados por el aire caliente que circula desde el calefactor.
Muebles:  mantenga un espacio de 152 mm (6 pulgadas) como 
mínimo entre los muebles y el calefactor, para permitir una circulación
de aire correcta.
1. Retire la cubierta del compartimiento de cables que está en el
extremo del calefactor, donde va a ingresar el cable de alimentación
eléctrica (Figura 3). Determine la ubicación de montaje deseada,
posicione el calefactor contra la pared y marque ésta (o el piso) en
el lugar donde la alimentación eléctrica va a ingresar al calefactor.
NOTA: para que el funcionamiento sea más eficiente, coloque los cale-
factores a lo largo de una pared exterior, bajo una ventana. Coloque el
calefactor de modo que pueda sujetarse a un travesaño de la pared. El
cable de alimentación eléctrica debe ingresar al calefactor a través de la
abrazadera para cables imcorporada o alguno de los prepunzonados
provistos en el compartimiento de cables.
2. Perfore un agujero en la pared (o en el piso) en el lugar deseado
para el ingreso de la alimentación eléctrica. Instale el cableado de
alimentación eléctrica al calefactor y a la ubicación del termostato de
acuerdo con la opción seleccionada de termostato. Deje en el cale-
factor una longitud de cable de 254 a 305 mm (de 10 a 12 pulg.)
aproximadamente, para conexiones.

INSTRUCCIONES DE OPERACIÓN
1. TEste calefactor debe instalarse correctamente antes de usarlo.
2. Después de haber finalizado la instalación del sistema del calefactor
de zócalo, todos los termostatos deben llevarse a la posición BAJA
(LOW) o NO CALENTAR (NO HEAT). Conecte los interruptores
automáticos, espere de 3 a 5 minutos y haga una revisión para veri-
ficar que ninguno de los calefactores esté funcionando. Si funcio-
nan, desconecte la alimentación eléctrica y revise el cableado. Si
ninguno está funcionando, lleve los termostatos a su posición máxi-
ma y espere de 3 a 5 minutos. Compruebe que el calefactor (todos
los calefactores) esté(n) funcionando. Si alguno no estuviera funcio-
nando, desconecte la alimentación eléctrica y revise el cableado.
3. Deje funcionar el sistema en forma continua durante ½ hora. Esto
debe eliminar los residuos aceitosos que hayan quedado de la fabri-
cación (puede generarse algo de humo).
4. Seleccione el ajuste más confortable en todos los termostatos.
5. Se ha suministrado un control de límite de seguridad, para apagar
automáticamente el calefactor si se lo bloquea o si se sobrecalienta
de cualquier modo debido a una condición anormal. Vea las Figuras
4 y 5.  NO puentee ni retire este dispositivo de seguridad del circuito
eléctrico. Vea la Advertencia 11 en la página 2. Este control de
seguridad no debe operar.en el uso normal. Si comprueba que este
control está operando, asegúrese de que el calefactor no esté blo-
queado. Si continúa haciendo ciclos de apagado del calefactor,
desconecte la alimentación eléctrica del mismo y haga que lo
inspeccione y/o repare un electricista calificado.
INSTRUCCIONES DE MANTENIMIENTO
Su calefactor le brindará muchos años de servicio y confort con sólo un
mínimo de cuidado. Para asegurar un funcionamiento eficiente, observe
las instrucciones simples que se indican a continuación.
1. El usuario puede realizar la limpieza básica del calefactor. Los
demás servicios deben estar a cargo de personal de servicio califi-
cado.
2. Debido a que el principio de calefacción por convección depende de
la circulación de aire a través de un elemento calefactor aleteado,
inevitablemente se acumulará polvo entre las aletas. Para obtener el
máximo rendimiento, el calefactor debe limpiarse en forma periódi-
ca.
3. Para limpiar las aletas del elemento calefactor, quite primero las
cubiertas de ambos compartimientos de cables y la cubierta frontal.
Elimine el polvo y la suciedad de las aletas de aluminio del elemento
calefactor mediante una aspiradora o aire comprimido. Cuide de no
dañar las aletas.
4. El gabinete pintado del calefactor puede limpiarse con un paño lig-
eramente húmedo. No use ceras o limpiadores abrasivos, ya que
pueden dañar el acabado o dejar un residuo que alterará el color.
5. Vuelva a colocar la cubierta frontal (asegúrese de que esté trabada
en su posición en la escuadra de soporte de cada elemento y en
cada extremo) y las cubiertas de los dos compartimientos de cables
(mediante los dos tornillos provistos), y restablezca la alimentación
eléctrica y verifique que el calefactor funcione correctamente.
Pintura
Si resulta necesario repintar el calefactor, utilice únicamente una pintura
de esmalte de alta calidad, apta para superficies metálicas, y observe
las instrucciones que se proporcionan con la pintura. NO pinte el ele-
mento calefactor ni el tubo capilar del límite de seguridad. Pinte única-
mente el exterior del gabinete.
1.
Un choque eléctrico podría producir lesiones graves o la muerte.
Asegúrese de que el circuito de alimentación eléctrica del 
calefactor esté desconectado en el tablero de servicio o desconec-
tador principal, antes de prestar servicio a este calefactor. Deje
enfriar el calefactor antes de limpiarlo, para prevenir una posible
quemadura.
2. Tenga cuidado al limpiar las aletas de los elementos calefactores,
para evitar dañarlas. Note también que las aletas son aguzadas y
pueden causar cortes; por eso, evite el contacto.

DÉBALLAGE DU RADIATEUR
Vérifiez le radiateur pour vous assurer qu’il n’a pas été endommagé
durant le transport. N’essayez pas d’installer ou de faire fonctionner le
radiateur s’il est endommagé. Ramenez-le à son lieu d'achat ou
déposez une réclamation auprès du transporteur.
INSTRUCTIONS D'INSTALLATION
Écartements minimaux
Du radiateur au sol : Le radiateur doit être directement monté sur le sol,
ou si on le souhaite au-dessus (comme au-dessus de la plinthe).
Jusqu'à 3/4 de pouce (19 mm) d’épaisseur de moquette peut s’installer
jusqu’au radiateur et autour dans la mesure où cela n’obstrue pas la cir-
culation d’air.
De radiateur à draperie : N’installez pas de radiateur à un endroit où des
rideaux ou draperies seraient en contact avec. Consultez la Figure 2
pour les écartements minimaux.
REMARQUE IMPORTANTE : Certaines étoffes et matières sont 
décolorées ou peuvent être endommagées par la chaleur. De ce fait,
évitez d’installer un radiateur contre des revêtements muraux en vinyle
ou sous des articles en vinyle ou en plastique, comme des persiennes
ou des rideaux en vinyle, car ils pourraient être endommagés par l’air
chaud qui sort du radiateur.
Mobilier: Maintenez un espacement d’au moins 6 pouces (152 mm)
entre mobilier et radiateur pour permettre une circulation d’air adéquate.
1. Enlevez le couvercle du compartiment de câblage à l’extrémité du
radiateur où le câble d’alimentation électrique doit entrer (Figure 3).
Déterminez l’emplacement de montage désiré, positionnez le radia-
teur au mur comme prévu et marquez le mur (ou le sol) à l’emplace-
ment où l’alimentation électrique doit pénétrer dans le radiateur. 
REMARQUE: Pour le fonctionnement le plus efficace, positionnez les
radiateurs le long des murs extérieurs, sous des fenêtres. Positionnez le
radiateur de façon à ce qu’il puisse être fixé à un poteau mural. Le câble
d’alimentation doit entrer dans le radiateur par le serre-câble ou l’un des
trous à enfoncer disponibles dans le compartiment de câblage.
2. Percez un trou dans le mur (ou dans le sol) à l’emplacement voulu
pour l’entrée de l’alimentation électrique. Installez le câblage d’ali-
mentation dans le radiateur et vers l’emplacement du thermostat,
selon l’option de thermostat choisie. Laissez environ 10-12 pouces
(254-305 mm) de fils pour les raccordements du radiateur.
3. Si d’autres accessoires de Marley sont à utiliser avec ce radiateur,
référez-vous aux instructions d’installation fournies pour installer et
câbler correctement. Visitez le site www.marleymep.com pour des
instructions sur certains accessoires communs.
4. Couvercle de chemin de câble – Radiateur-plinthe commercial
uniquement
a. Le couvercle de chemin de câble est un dispositif installé en usine
pour les radiateurs-plinthes commerciaux de Marley. Deux câbles
ou quatre conducteurs individuels plus deux fils de terre peuvent
être acheminés par ce chemin de câble. Référez-vous en page 1
au Tableau 1 pour le calibre des fils et les charges de courant..
b. Pour accéder au chemin de câble, posez le radiateur face vers le
bas et enlevez les vis maintenant le chemin de câble de l’arrière
POUR RÉDUIRE LE RISQUE DE DÉPART D’INCENDIE, DE COM-
MOTION ÉLECTRIQUE ET DE BLESSURES AUX PERSONNES,
OBSERVEZ LES CONSIGNES SUIVANTES :
1.
Une blessure sérieuse voire mortelle peut résulter d’une commo-
tion électrique. Assurez-vous que le circuit du secteur d’alimenta-
tion électrique arrivant au radiateur est bien débranché en amont à
l’interrupteur général ou au panneau de service avant d’installer ce
radiateur.
2. Les procédures de câblage et les connexions doivent être en con-
formité avec la norme électrique américaine (NEC) et les normes
locales. Référez-vous au schéma de câblage du radiateur en
Figure 5. Assurez-vous que toutes les connexions électriques sont
bien serrées pour éviter une possible surchauffe. N’utilisez que des
fils d’alimentation en cuivre.
3. Vérifiez que la tension du secteur correspond à la tension nominale
telle qu’imprimée sur la plaque signalétique du radiateur (Voir la
Figure 1).
ATTENTION – Ne branchez jamais un radiateur sur une source de ten-
sion supérieure à celle de sa plaque signalétique, car cela l'en-
dommagerait et pourrait causer un départ d'incendie.
4.
N’installez pas le radiateur contre des surfaces inflammables de
panneaux de fibre en cellulose de faible densité, contre ou sous
des revêtements muraux en vinyle, ou sous tous les matériaux
pouvant être endommagés par la chaleur, comme des stores en
vinyle ou en plastique, des rideaux, etc.
5. N’utilisez pas le radiateur sous une prise d’alimentation secteur.
6. ATTENTION – Le radiateur fonctionne à des températures
élevées. Maintenez les cordons électriques (dont les câbles du
téléphone et de l’ordinateur), les tentures et autres parties de
l’ameublement à distance du radiateur. Pour un fonctionnement sûr
et efficace, nous recommandons de garder 6 pouces (152 mm) d’é-
cartement au-dessus et devant le radiateur en permanence.
Consultez la Figure 2 sur les exigences d’écartement minimal pour
draperie.
7. Pour réduire le risque de départ d’incendie, n’entreposez pas et
n’utilisez pas d’essence ou d’autres produits inflammables sous
forme de liquide ou de vapeurs à proximité du radiateur.
8. N’installez pas le radiateur renversé ou dans toute autre position
autre que celle montrée dans ce manuel. L’étiquette d’avertisse-
ment avec le mot “TOP” doit être en haut quand le radiateur est
installé.
9. N’encastrez pas le radiateur dans un mur, ou ne l’installez pas
dans un quelconque type d’enceinte, car cela provoquerait sa sur-
chauffe et pourrait créer un danger.
10. Au montage du radiateur, si les trous de montage inférieurs ne sont
pas utilisés (Voir la Figure 4), assurez-vous que des vis n’endom-
magent pas le câblage d’alimentation dans la zone derrière le radi-
ateur.
11. N’enlevez pas et ne contournez pas le contrôle de limite de sécu-
rité car cela pourrait faire du radiateur un risque de départ d’in-
cendie – consultez la figure 4.
12. En cas d’utilisation d’un relais de transformateur RSA accessoire,
le câblage d’alimentation fourni dans le compartiment où est instal-
lé cet accessoire doit pouvoir supporter 90 °C au minimum.

deux boîtiers de terminaison.
c. Insérez les isolants en plastique du kit de pièces (dans le 
compartiment de câblage) dans les trous enfoncés. 
d. Câblez le radiateur en fonction des schémas de câblage de la
Figure 5. Remettez en place le couvercle de chemin de câble
avec ses vis.
5. Desserrez la vis du collier serre-câble (Figure 4) ou ouvrez le trou à
enfoncer voulu du compartiment de câblage du radiateur. Installez le
câble d’alimentation électrique dans le compartiment de câblage en
laissant au moins 6 pouces (153 mm) de câble pour le raccordement
au radiateur. Pour installer deux câbles d’alimentation en utilisant le
collier serre-câble intégré, courbez vers le haut la patte couvrant le
deuxième trou et ramenez-la vers la cloison arrière du compartiment
de câblage. Si un serre-câble intégré n’est pas utilisé, installez une
retenue de câble approuvée (non incluse) dans le trou à enfoncer
choisi.
REMARQUE: Des perforations marquées d’une croix pour le montage
sont fournies à l’arrière du carter de radiateur au-dessus de l’élément de
chauffe aux emplacements pour vis de montage (Voir la Figure 4). 
6. Positionnez le radiateur à l’emplacement voulu et fixez-le au mur
avec des vis à bois ou de la visserie appropriée. Localisez les
poteaux muraux et si possible fixez les vis dedans. Pour des radia-
teurs jusqu’à 6 pieds (1,8 m) de long, une vis à chaque extrémité est
adéquate. Pour des unités plus longues, une vis additionnelle au
centre est nécessaire. Serrez ces vis, puis desserrez-les d’un quart
de tour pour permettre au radiateur de se dilater et de se contracter
pendant son utilisation. Si l’unité est montée au-dessus du sol, deux
trous de montage additionnels sont fournis à chaque extrémité sous
l’élément de chauffe (Voir la Figure 4). Installez une vis supplémen-
taire à chaque extrémité pour la stabilité, en vous assurant de les
dévisser chacune d’au moins un quart de tour.
7. Branchez le connecteur de terre du câble d’alimentation sur la
queue de cochon en cuivre nu dans le compartiment de câblage.
8. En suivant le schéma de câblage souhaité, comme montré en Figure
5, branchez l’alimentation électrique au radiateur en utilisant des
bouchons de raccordement de fils approuvés
REMARQUE: Quand des accessoires sont installés, utilisez les sché-
mas de câblage fournis avec.
9. Si le couvercle frontal é été enlevé, remettez-le en place en
accrochant son bord supérieur sur les équerres de support. Puis,
poussez-le vers le bas pour le verrouiller dans ses équerres de sup-
port.
10. Remettez en place les couvercles de compartiments de câblage.
11. Suivez les instructions accompagnant le thermostat pour son instal-
lation et son câblage. Visitez le site www.marleymep.com pour trou-
ver des schémas de câblage types de thermostat.
INSTRUCTIONS D’UTILISATION
1. Le radiateur doit être correctement installé avant d’être utilisé.
2. Une fois que le système de radiateurs-plinthes a été complètement
installé, tous les thermostats doivent être passés en position LOW
ou NO HEAT. Établissez l’alimentation secteur, attendez 3 à 5 min-
utes et vérifiez qu’aucun des radiateurs n’est en fonctionnement. Si
un radiateur chauffe déjà, débranchez-le et vérifiez le câblage. Si
aucun radiateur ne chauffe, passez les thermostats sur la position la
plus forte et attendez de nouveau 3 à 5 minutes. Vérifiez que tous
les radiateurs chauffent bien. Si un radiateur ne chauffait pas,
débranchez-le et vérifiez le câblage.
3. Laissez le système complet fonctionner régulièrement pendant 1/2
heure. Cela devrait éliminer tous les résidus huileux de la production
(Il peut se produire un peu de fumée).
4. Choisissez un réglage de confort sur tous les thermostats.
5. Un contrôle de limite de sécurité est fourni pour couper automatique-
ment le radiateur s’il est obstrué ou chauffe trop pour toute raison,
du fait de conditions anormales (Voir les Figures 4 et 5). NE con-
tournez PAS ou ne désactivez pas ce dispositif de sécurité (Voyez
l’avertissement 11 en page 2). Durant un fonctionnement normal ce
dispositif de contrôle ne doit pas s’activer. Si vous constatez que de
contrôle s’active, assurez-vous que le radiateur n’est pas obstrué. Si
le radiateur continue d’être coupé en chauffant, débranchez son ali-
mentation et faites-le vérifier et réparer par un électricien qualifié.
INSTRUCTIONS D’ENTRETIEN
Votre radiateur vous fournira des années de bon service et de confort
avec juste un minimum de soins. Pour assurer son fonctionnement effi-
cace, suivez les instructions simples ci-dessous :
1. L’utilisateur peut effectuer lui-même un nettoyage élémentaire du
radiateur. Toute autre intervention est réservée au personnel de
service qualifié.
2. Du fait du principe de chauffage par convection, qui dépend de l’air
circulant autour du radiateur, de la poussière peut s’amasser entre
les ailettes. Le radiateur doit être nettoyé annuellement pour une
efficacité maximale.
3. Pour nettoyer les ailettes d’élément de chauffe, enlevez d’abord les
couvercles de compartiment de câblage et le couvercle frontal. À
l’aide d’un aspirateur ou d’air comprimé, enlevez la poussière et la
peluche des ailettes en aluminium d’élément de chauffe tout en
faisant attention pour ne pas les endommager.
4. Le coffret peint du radiateur peut se nettoyer en utilisant un chiffon
légèrement mouillé. Mais n’utilisez pas de nettoyants puissants, d’a-
gents de polissage ou de cirage, car ils pourraient endommager la
surface ou laisser un résidu qui la décolorerait.
5. Remettez en place le couvercle frontal (en vous assurant qu’il est
verrouillé en place à chaque équerre de support d’élément et à
chaque extrémité) et les deux couvercles de compartiment de
câblage (en utilisant les deux vis fournies), et rétablissez l’alimenta-
tion puis vérifiez le bon fonctionnement du radiateur.puis vérifiez le
bon fonctionnement du radiateur.
Peinture
S’il devient nécessaire de repeindre le radiateur, n’utilisez que de la
peinture émaillée de qualité convenant aux surfaces métalliques, en
suivant les instructions fournies avec. NE peignez PAS sur l’élément de
chauffe ou le tube capillaire de limite de sécurité. Ne repeignez que sur
l’extérieur du coffret de radiateur. 
1.
Une blessure sérieuse voire mortelle peut résulter d’une commo-
tion électrique. Assurez-vous que le circuit du secteur d’alimenta-
tion électrique arrivant au radiateur est bien débranché en amont à
l’interrupteur général ou au panneau de service avant d’intervenir
sur ce radiateur. Laissez le radiateur refroidir avant de le nettoyer
pour éviter de possibles brûlures.
2. Faites attention en nettoyant les ailettes de l’élément de chauffe pour
éviter de les endommager. Retenez aussi que les ailettes sont
tranchantes et peuvent vous couper, évitez donc tout contact.

P-475,https://www.marleymep.com/system/files/node/file/field-file//5200-2295-003_1.pdf,No,"IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
When using electrical appliances, basic precautions should always
be followed to reduce the risk of fire, electric shock and injury to
persons, including the following:
1.
Read all instructions before using the heater.
2.
This heater is hot when in use. To avoid burns, do not let bare skin
touch hot surfaces. Always use handle when moving heater. Keep
combustibles such as furniture, pillows, bedding, papers, clothes,
and curtains at least 3 feet (.9 m) from front of heater and keep them
away from sides and rear.
3.
Extreme caution is necessary when any heater is used by or near
children or invalids and whenever the heater is left operating and
unattended.
4.
Always unplug heater when not in use.
5.
Do not operate any heater with a damaged cord or plug, if heater
malfunctions, or has been dropped or damaged in any matter.
Heater must be repaired by qualified electrician.
6.
Do not use heater outdoors.
7.
This heater is not intended for use in wet or damp locations. Never
locate heater where it may fall into bathtub or other water container.
8.
Do not run cord under carpeting. Do not cover cord with throw rugs,
runner or the like. Arrange cord away from traffic area and where it
will not be tripped over.
9.
To disconnect heater, turn selector knob to the “OFF” position, then
remove plug from outlet.
10. Connect to properly grounded outlets only.
11. Do not insert or allow foreign objects to enter any ventilation or
exhaust openings as this may cause electric shock or fire, or dam-
age the heater.
12. To prevent a possible fire, do not block air intakes or exhaust in any
manner. Do not use on soft surfaces, like a bed, where openings
may become blocked.
13. A heater has hot and arcing or sparking parts inside. Do not use it in
area where gasoline, paint, or other flammable liquids are used or
stored.
14. Use heater only as described in this manual. Any other use not rec-
ommended by the manufacturer may cause fire, electric shock, or
personal injury.
15. Avoid the use of an extension cord because the extension cord may
overheat and cause a risk of fire. However, if you have to use an
extension cord, the cord must be at least No. 14 AWG and rated not
less than 1875 watts. (MMHD requires 3 wire grounded cord and
plug.)
16. This heater is provided with an over-heat protective device that
automatically shuts the heater down, OFF, if the discharge is
blocked of an unsafe temperature rise is encountered for any rea-
son. A one-shot device for extra safety precaution also protects it.
MMH Series
Utility Heaters
Features
• Tip-Over Switch - shuts heater off automatically if unit tips over.
• Pilot Light - glows when heater is plugged in.
• Over-Temperature Safety Cutoff - Automatically shuts down the heater if
there is an unsafe temperature situation for any reason.
• Fan-Only Operation - allows fan to operate without heating.
Assembly
This heater comes with the handle unattached. Use the screws provided to
attach handle to the top of the heater.
Model MMH 1502TB
The MMH heater is equipped with a polarized (2-blade) plug with one-blade
wider than the other.
CAUTION: The polarized plug will fit into the wall outlet in only one way. If it
still does not fit, contact an electrician to replace your obsolete outlet. 
DO NOT defeat this important safety feature. To do so could result in an 
electric shock hazard.
Model MMHD 1502TB
The MMHD heater is provided with a grounded (3 blade) plug.
CAUTION: The grounded plug must be used with a grounded outlet. Do not
use an adapter in a 2-slot wall outlet unless the ground lug of the adapter is
properly connected to a known building ground. Failure to use heater with
properly grounded outlet or adapter could result in an electric shock hazard. 
TO OPERATE
1. Plug the heater power cord directly into a standard grounded 110-120 volt
AC outlet. Always operate the heater in the upright position with the rubber
feet on the floor.
CAUTION: Be sure plug fits tightly into outlet. A loose fit will cause overheat-
ing and damage to the plug. Plug may feel warm during normal usage. If you
must use an extension cord with this heater, the extension cord must be at
least a No. 14 AWG rate for for 1875 watts. (MMHD requires 3 wire ground-
ed cord and plug.)
2. Rotate wattage selector knob to the “1500 W” position This provides the 
maximum heat output.
3. Rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob clockwise (right) to the “HIGH” setting 
until the knob stops. The heater should begin heating and the fan should 
start to blow warm air.
4. Allow the heater to operate until the room temperature reaches the desired
level, then slowly rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob counter-clockwise (left)
until the heater cycles off. At this setting, the heater will cycle on and off 
automatically to maintain this comfort level.
SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS
NOTE: Do not force knob beyond its normal stop position. It may be neces-
sary to make minor adjustments to the thermostat to maintain the desired
comfort level. Clockwise movement will increase the room temperature.
Counter-clockwise movement will decrease room temperature.
5. To conserve energy, the heater may be operated at a lower wattage by 
rotating control knob to the “1300 W” position.
6. When heater is not needed, rotate control knob to the “OFF” position, 
remove the plug from outlet, and move heater to safe place for storage.
IMPORTANT NOTE
Do not expect the heating coils on your heater to glow. Coil elements are nor-
mally dark. Air movement over these coils prevents glowing yet provides
warm air, similar to a forced-air furnace. Some glow may occur where the
moving air does not directly touch the coils.
IMPORTANT NOTE
Manual Reset Instructions: “If the heater shuts down.”
1. Turn thermostat mode to OFF position.
2. Unplug heater from wall and wait 10 minutes.
3. Plug heater back in to wall receptacle and turn thermostat knob to “ON”.
CLEANING AND STORAGE
Turn selector switch “OFF”, then remove plug from electrical outlet before
cleaning heater. Use a soft cloth for dusting. For cleaning use only a damp
rag and non-abrasive dish detergent. Do not use abrasive or chemical clean-
ers as these may harm finish. If heater is used in a very dusty location, use
a vacuum cleaner dust brush to remove dust and other foreign material from
grilles. Always unplug cord and wrap around heater when not in  use. Move
heater to a safe location for storage.
SERVICE
This heater does not require any routine maintenance other than occasional
cleaning to prevent clogging of intake grille openings. To clean air intake
grille, use vacuum with brush attachment or high pressure air. The motor is
permanently lubricated. Do not operate the heater with a damaged cord or
plug or if the heater malfunctions or has been damaged in any manner.

Installation of Back Box With
Surface-Mounting Frame
(See Figure 3).
1. Secure back box to wall (with knockouts in upper right
hand corner) using screws and anchors.
2. Hang the surface-mounting frame on the back box.
Ensure that the back edge of the surface-mounting
frame is flush against the wall.
NOTE: If heater is located in a high traffic area where it may
be subjected to vandalism or abuse, take extreme care to see
that the box is firmly attached to the wall.
3. Power Supply Wiring
NOTE: Wiring Compartment Volume - 119""3 (1950cm3).
a. Run a power supply cable into the area of the upper
right corner of the mounting frame. All wiring must be in
accordance to National and local Electrical Codes.
Refer to Table 1 for proper wire sizes.
NOTE: If the wiring is to run through the wall, cut a hole in the
wall near the top of the back box. Run the supply wire
through this hole. Then remove the knockout from the top of
the box and proceed to step c.
b. Remove the knockout on the top side of the frame.
c. Feed the power supply cable through the frame allow-
ing 6"" (152mm) of lead to remain inside the frame
d. Secure the power supply cable to the back box
(using cable clamps, connector, or other suitable strain
relief) allowing 6”(152mm) of lead to remain inside the
inner housing.
e. Ground the back box by connecting the supply ground
leadwire to the green ground screw located in the
inside top of the back box.
Installation of Heater Assembly and Grille
After back box is completely installed and no further con-
struction dirt is expected, clean debris from back box, remove
heater assembly from its carton, then refer to Figure 4 and
proceed as follows:
1. Insert the heater assembly into back box, placing
the four mounting holes (with key-hole slots) over the
screws in the back box. Tighten all screws securely.
2. If surface-mounting frame is used, ensure that the
frame is even with all four heater assembly tabs before
tightening screws.
3. Connect the lead wires from the disconnect switch to
the lead wires from the fan deck. (See wiring diagrams)
After connection, push wires back into opening.
4. Turn thermostat to the extreme counterclockwise
position.
5. Mount the grille using four (4) long screws provided.
The screws thread into holes located in the side
flanges of the back box.
6. Push thermostat knob onto thermostat shaft.
Operation
1. Turn power to heater on at main switch panel. Rotate the
thermostat knob fully clockwise. This should energize the
heating elements and the fan, causing air to flow from the
air discharge at the openings in the bottom of the grille.
2. After the discharge air has become warm, rotate the
thermostat knob to the desired position to obtain room
comfort.
NOTE: For best results, the heater should be left ON con-
stantly during the heating season since the thermostat, when
properly set, will maintain the desired temperature.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Maintenance
TO RESET MANUAL RESET LIMIT
Your heater is equipped with a manual reset safety thermal

escape de tensión (provisto en el campo).
3. 
Atrape el cableado de campo a través del escape de tensión dejan-
do 6"" de cable dentro de la caja.
4. 
Inserte la caja posterior en el corte. La parte posterior de la caja
debe estar al ras con el reverso de la pared de montante.
5. 
Usando cuatro (4) tornillos para madera o tornillos de tabique o cua-
tro (provistos en el campo) o cuatro (4) clavos (provisto en el
campo), asegure la caja posterior a los montantes (vea la Fig.1B).
Si los montantes de pared son más grandes que una distancia de
16"" desde el centro (oc) , use sólo 2 sujetadores y al lado opuesto
de la caja posterior inserte un tornillo para lámina metálica de 1""
(provisto) a través del orificio en la tapa del extremo. Esto afirmará
la caja posterior al tabique cuando se instale la rejilla. (Vea la Fig 4).
INSTALACION DEL CONJUNTO DEL TERMOSTATO 
(RT2 solamente)
NOTA:  El conjunto del termostato no debe instalarse hasta después que
se haya completado la construcción de los tabiques. El polvo proveniente
de la instalación y del compuesto de juntas de los tabiques puede ser 
perjudicial si penetra en los componentes del conjunto del termostato. 
1. El termostato debe instalarse en el extremo derecho del calentador.
2. Coloque el termostato en posición sobre la ranura en el extremo dere-
cho de la caja posterior. Empuje la aleta de la ménsula del termostato
a través de la ranura del tope y al extremo derecho de la caja poste-
rior hasta que la ménsula calce en su lugar. Vea la Fig. 5.

Observer les procédures suivantes pour réduire le temps d’instal-
lation à un minimum. POUR RÉ 
DUIRE LE RISQUE D’ÉLEC 
-
TRO 
CUTION ET D’INCENDIE: 
1.
Couper le courant venant au radiateur au tableau d’alimentation
principal avant de câbler ou d’effectuer un entretien.
2.
Tout le câblage doit être conforme aux codes électriques en
vigueur et le radiateur doit être mis à la terre.

Ce radiateur est chaud lorsqu’il fonctionne. Pour éviter les
brûlures, ne pas laisser la peau nue toucher les surfaces chaudes.
5.
Ne pas insérer ni laisser des corps étrangers entrer par les ouver-
tures de ventilation ou de sortie d’air car cela peut causer une élec-
trocution, un incendie ou une détérioration du radiateur.
6.
Ne pas boucher les prises d’air ni les sorties d’air. Garder les
matériaux combustibles, comme les boîtes, les cageots, les
rideaux, etc... éloignés du radiateur. Ne pas installer le radiateur
derrière des portes, des meubles, des serviettes ou des boîtes.
7.
Un radiateur contient des pièces chaudes et produisant des arcs
électriques ou des étincelles. Ne pas l’utiliser dans des zones 
d’utilisation ou de remisage d’essence, de peinture ou de liquides
inflammables.
8.
Utiliser ce radiateur uniquement selon les instructions de ce
manuel. Toute autre utilisation non recommandée par le fabricant
peut causer un incendie, une électrocution ou des blessures.
9.
Ce radiateur n’est pas approuvé pour utilisation dans les atmo-
sphères corrosives, comme les zones de remisage de produits
chimiques, les serres ou les zones maritimes.

boîtier arrière doivent reposer sur la plaque de semelle du mur pour
assurer un bon espacement et assurer que le radiateur soit bien
hori 
zontal (voir la figure 1B).
6. 
À l’aide de quatre vis à bois ou quatre vis à placo-plâtre, ou quatre
clous (fournis sur le site), fixer le boîtier arrière sur les poutres (voir
la figure 1B). Les supports du boîtier arrière peuvent désormais être
enlevés. S’ils ne sont pas enlevés, les fixer sur la plaque de semelle.
INSTALLATION DU BOÎTIER ARRIÈRE DANS UNE 
CONSTRUCTION NEUVE - ESPACEMENT DES POUTRES
SUPÉRIEUR À 406 mm (VOIR LA FIGURE 2)
REMARQUE: La figure 2 décrit le boîtier arrière installé avec le côté
gauche contre une poutre. Pour un boîtier avec le côté droit contre une
poutre, inverser les instructions ci-dessous.
1.
Identifier l’emplacement du boîtier arrière et des supports de boîtier
arrière (2). Le boîtier arrière doit être installé avec les rails de fixa-
tion sur le dessus (voir la figure 2B).
2.
Déterminer le côté du boîtier arrière qui doit être contre une poutre
et insérer le support de boîtier arrière de ce côté avec la languette
de pied orientée vers le centre du boîtier arrière. Sur le côté du 
boîtier arrière qui n’est pas contre une poutre, installer le support de
boîtier arrière avec la languette de pied orientée vers l’extrémité du
boîtier et le bloquer sur le boîtier avec une vis à tôle longue de 9 mm
(fournie).
3.

sant 152 mm de fil dans le boîtier
5.
Insérer le boîtier arrière dans le mur, en alignant l’arrière du boîtier
arrière avec l’arrière de la poutre (voir la figure 2C). Les supports du
boîtier arrière doivent reposer sur la plaque de semelle du mur pour
assurer un bon espacement et assurer que le radiateur soit bien hor-
izontal (voir la figure 2B).
6.
Utiliser deux (2) vis à bois ou vis à placo-plâtre ou deux (2) clous
(fournis sur le site) pour bloquer le côté du boîtier arrière qui est con-
tre une poutre. Utiliser une (1) vis à bois ou vis à placo-plâtre ou un
(1) clou (fourni sur le site) pour bloquer la languette de pied du sup-
port de boîtier arrière (sur l’extrémité opposée à la poutre) sur la
plaque de semelle (voir la figure 2B).
INSTALLATION DU BOÎTIER ARRIÈRE DANS 
UNE CONSTRUCTION EXISTANTE
1.
Identifier l’emplacement des poutres murales pour s’assurer de pou-
voir faire toute la découpe entre les poutres. Au moins un des côtés
de la découpe doit être au ras d’une poutre. Le bas de la découpe
doit être au moins 101 mm au-dessus du sol fini. Faire une découpe
dans le mur de 368 mm de large et de 171 mm de haut (voir la 
figure 3). 
2.
Déterminer la découpe du boîtier arrière à utiliser pour le câblage
sur le site et la retirer (voir le plan du boîtier arrière page 1). Installer
le dispositif de reprise des contraintes (fourni sur le site). 
3.

sant 152 mm de fil dans le boîtier
4.
Insérer le boîtier arrière dans la découpe. L’arrière du boîtier arrière
doit être au ras de l’arrière des poutres.
5.
Avec quatre (4) vis à bois ou vis à placo-plâtre (fournies sur le site)
ou quatre (4) clous (fournis sur le site), bloquer le boîtier arrière sur
les poutres (voir la figure 1B). Si les poutres murales sont à plus de
406 mm de distance, n’utiliser que 2 fixations et, sur l’extrémité
opposée du boîtier arrière, visser une vis à tôle de 25 mm (fournie)
dans le trou du bouchon d’extrémité. Ceci ammène la boîtier arrière
contre le placo-plâtre lorsque la grille est installée (voir la figure 4).
INSTALLATION DU THERMOSTAT (RT2 uniquement)
REMARQUE: Le thermostat ne doit pas être installé avant la fin de la
phase de placo-plâtre de la construction. La poussière d’installation du
placo-plâtre et du mastic de joint peut être nocive si elle entre dans les
composants du thermostat. 
1. 
Il faut installer le thermostat dans l’extrémité droite du radiateur.
2.
Positionner le thermostat au-dessus de la fente dans l’extrémité
droite du boîtier arrière. Pousser la languette sur le support de ther-
mostat dans la fente de l’extrémité supérieure droite du boîtier arrière
jusqu’à ce que le support se bloque en place. Voir la figure 5.

from traffic area and where it will not be tripped over.
9. To disconnect heater, turn selector knob to the “OFF”
position, then remove plug from outlet.
10. Connect to properly grounded outlets only.
11. Do not insert or allow foreign objects to enter any ven-
tilation or exhaust openings as this may cause electric
shock or fire, or damage the heater.
12. To prevent a possible fire, do not block air intakes or
exhaust in any manner. Do not use on soft surfaces,
like a bed, where openings may become blocked.
13. A heater has hot and arcing or sparking parts inside.
Do not use it in area where gasoline, paint, or other
flammable liquids are used or stored.
14. Use heater only as described in this manual. Any

MCM1503
Utility Heater
1
FEATURES
• Tip-Over Switch - shuts heater off automatically if unit  
tips over.
• Pilot Light - glows when heater is plugged in.
• Manual Reset Over-Temperature Safety Cutoff - auto-
matically turns heater off if overheating occurs.
Model MCM1503
This heater is provided with a grounded (3 blade) plug for use
on 110-120 volts AC.
CAUTION: The grounded plug must be used with a
grounded outlet. Do not use an adapter in a 2-slot wall
outlet unless the ground lug of the adapter is properly con-
nected to a known building ground. Failure to use heater
with properly grounded outlet or adapter could result in an
electric shock hazard. The adapter should not be used if a
3 slot grounded receptacle is available.
TO OPERATE
1. Plug the heater power cord directly into a standard 
grounded 110-120 volt AC outlet. Always operate the 
heater in the upright position with the rubber feet on the 
floor.
CAUTION: Be sure plug fits tightly into outlet. A loose fit
will cause overheating and damage to the plug. Plug may
feel warm during normal usage.
2. Rotate heat selection knob to “LOW” (600W), “MED” 
(900W) or HIGH (1500W) setting.
3. Rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob clockwise (right)until 
the knob stops. The heater should begin heating. At 
“LOW” (600W) the fan will not operate. At “MED” 
(900W) and “HIGH” (1500W) settings, the fan should 
start to blow warm air.
4. Allow the heater to operate until the room temperature 
reaches the desired level, then slowly rotate the 
“THERMOSTAT” knob counter-clockwise (left) until the 
heater cycles off. At this setting, the heater will cycle on 
and off automatically to maintain this comfort level.
NOTE: Do not force knob beyond its normal stop 
position. It may be necessary to make minor 
adjustments to the thermostat to maintain the 
desired comfort level. Clockwise movement will 
increase the room temperature. Counter-clockwise 
movement will decrease room temperature.
5. To conserve energy, the heater may be operated at a 
lower wattage by placing the heat selection knob at the 
“LOW” (600W) or MED (900W) settings.
6. When heater is not needed, rotate control knob to the 
“OFF” position, remove the plug from outlet, and move 
heater to safe place for storage.
CLEANING & CARE
Your heater is designed for trouble-free operation with little
maintenance. However, routine cleaning is recommended
as follows:
1. Before attempting to clean heater, turn heater to “OFF” 
position and remove plug from outlet.
2. Using damp cloth, wipe dust and dirt from heater to  
cabinet. Do not use waxes as they may discolor.
3. When heater is not to be used for an extended time, 
turn to “OFF” position, unplug from outlet and place 
heater in safe place, such as a box, to prevent possible 
damage.
TO RESET OVER-TEMPERATURE CONTROL
This heater is equipped with a built-in over-temperature
safety switch that will cycle the heater off if the heater
overheats. After heater is allowed to cool and the condition
that caused the overheating is corrected, using a small
straight object, such as a pencil, push in button located
inside small hole on side of heater marked “RESET”.

Schedule programming
The TH110A-DP-P allows 4 setting changes for each day of the week. There are
no pre-set programs.The programs are tailored to perfectly adapt to your life
style. The principle is very simple. For each day, enter the time at which you wake
up (P1), the time you leave for work (P2), the time you arrive back home (P3) and
the time you go to bed (P4).
Mode
For savings to be obtained, you must lower the temperature for a period of 2 to 3
times the delay required to bring the temperature back to your comfort level.
Example : If your system takes one hour to go from your saving temperature level
to your comfort temperature Ievel, it is useless to lower the temperature for a
period less than 2 to 3 hours.

The CRS is designed to meet the toughest requirements in cleanroom
and BSL applications. 
The enclosed and gasketed housing and one-piece
door protect against inﬁltration of airborne bacteria. Die-formed edges on
the door frame and the hole-free housing prevent air exchange between
the ﬁxture and plenum, allowing re-lamping without contaminating the
area. One-piece gaskets are included on the lens for easy replacement
and on door edge. UL/cUL listed for wet locations. IP65 rated and
manufactured in accordance with ISO 14644, NSF and Federal Standard
209E in a certiﬁed ISO 9001:2000 facility.

The Fail-Safe CFF is designed for use in horizontal or non-laminar air 
flow clean rooms. The enclosed and gasketed housing and one-piece, 
outside flanged door protect against infiltration of airborne bacteria. 
The die formed edges on the door frame and the hole-free design of the 
housing prevent air exchange between the fixture and plenum, allowing 
relamping without contamination of the clean areas. UL/cUL listed for 
wet locations under covered ceilings.

Features, Catalog Logic 
and Options
The MPW
A features a reﬂector
system in the lower optical
compartment that facilitates two
tasks-reading and patient
examination. 
The MPWA is used for obtaining
maximum efﬁciency while
providing cut off and glare control
to the remaining of the room’s
surroundings.  With the push of a
switch, the upper lamp of the
lower compartment can be
energized to aid in evaluation of
the patient.  
The reﬂector works
with this lamp by providing
maximum output and control of
light over the patient’s torso for
examination or any other tasks
that may be necessary.  
The
effectiveness of this lamp/optical
system is maximized by its
ﬂexibility in utilizing these two
lamps in conjunction or
separately.  
Ballasts
Fixtures are supplied standard
with electronic ballasts.
Magnetic, energy saving ballasts
are available with 
T8 lamps only
(LEOC8).  An optional radio
interference ﬁlter (RIF) is
commonly used with magnetic
ballasts to reduce radio
interference with sensitive
equipment.   
Circuitry
All individual input circuits will be
supplied with a quick disconnect
module (QDM) to facilitate ease of
maintenance and installation.
GCO (grounded convenience
outlet) and FNL (ﬂuorescent night
light) options are commonly run
on separate circuits. Each will be
supplied with a QDM, separate
from the primary lamp sources
and will require additional
switching and wiring by others.
All primary lamp sources are
wired onto the same circuit unless
speciﬁed otherwise (See
Switching Controls).  
Exam Light
EXL Feature-This feature
includes a specular reﬂector that
separates the two lower lamps.
The upper lamp in the lower
compartment is for use as an
exam light.  
The lower lamp in the
same compartment is intended for
reading and other ordinary tasks.
(The upper lamp in the lower
compartment is switched
independently of the primary
lamp system via a rocker switch;
add ""R"" for installation on right
side of unit, EXLR; add ""L"" for
installation on left side of unit,
EXLL).  
Switching Controls
No switching option speciﬁed
implies the ﬁxture will ship with
input leads left unwired for switch
wiring to be completed in ﬁeld as
desired. 
PS4-4-position pull chain
switching. All primary lamps
(except EXL lamp) wired in
sequence by following: lower
lamps on, upper lamps on, all
lamps on, all lamps off.  (120V
only, brushed nickel ﬁnish,
installed in center of unit on
bottom of power tray).  
PS1D-2 position pull chain switch,
controls the bottom lamp
compartment only (except EXL
lamp).  (120V only, brushed nickel
ﬁnish, installed in center of unit
on bottom of power tray).  Upper
lamp compartment is on a
separate circuit to be wired and
switched at wall or as desired.
L
VCP-Low voltage controller,
patient controlled.  Mounted
inside unit for patient control of
all primary lamps-upper and
lower lamp compartments. Wired
in sequence for lower lamp on
(except EXL lamp), upper lamps
on, all lamps on, all lamps off.
Includes 1/4"" phone jack type
receptacle centered in bottom of
wire way for input control by
others or may be used with
accessory MBC-momentary
button cord switch (See
accessories).  
Other Options
EL4, EL5-The emergency battery
pack option is a good candidate
for facilities that do not have
emergency generator systems.
Test switch and indicator light will
be installed on top of unit in
middle of the power tray.  
FNL- Fluorescent night-light, 2-pin
(G23 Base), 7 or 9w twin tube
lamp installed in center of upper
compartment of ﬁxture, uses a
magnetic ballast. FNL is wired on
a separate circuit.   (Lamps by
others). 
GCO-Grounded convenience
outlet. White in color on units
with white ﬁnish; black in color on
all other ﬁnish options, wired on a
separate circuit.  (120V only,
maximum 10 amps, installed on
bottom right side facing unit; add
""L"" for installation on left side of
unit, GCOL).  
GLR-Fuse and holder, wired to
primary lamp circuit only.    
RIF-Radio interference ﬁlter, for
use with magnetic 
T8 ballast only.
(1 per ballast).  
SF1-Tamper-proof 
Torx™-head
fasteners
Accessories
MBC-Momentary button cord
switch. May be used with LVCP or
LVCF options to control lamps.  All
units are wired at factory as
speciﬁed per catalog logic (See
Switching Controls).  
VRSD-Torx™-head tamper-proof
screwdriver (for use with SF1
option)
Maintenance
The MPWA is designed to
facilitate ease of maintenance.  
Its three part assembly makes for
efﬁcient installation.  No tools are
required for relamping or
substituting electrical power trays
on standard ﬁxtures. When
maintenance is required, simply
loosen the two end thumbscrews
and slide the partial clamshell,
front lens assembly forward and
off.  
The lamps and power tray
will now be accessible and can be
removed by  quarter-turn
fasteners.  
This assembly hangs
suspended on the back pan while
it is easily disconnected via a
quick disconnect power
connector.  Spare units can speed
the maintenance process by easily
substituting the power tray, thus
causing less disruption in the
room.

Designed to meet the toughest requirements in cleanroom and BSL
applications. For use in horizontal or non-laminar air ﬂow rooms, the
enclosed and gasketed housing and one-piece door protect against
inﬁltration of airborne bacteria. Die-formed edges on the door frame and
the hole-free design of the housing prevent air exchange between the
ﬁxture and the plenum, allowing for re-lamping without contaminating
the area. One piece gaskets are included on lens, for easy replacement,
and on the door edge. 
The CRL is suitable for 9/16"", 1"" and 1-1/2""

less about security needs with Honeywell 
Pro-Watch software. 
PRO-WATCH INTEGRATED SECURITY SUITE combines the power of Pro-Watch 
Access Control, Pro-Watch Intelligent Command with Pro-Watch VMS to create 
information-driven insights that are delivered in a unified dashboard.  System 
tools such as system health dashboards and bulk firmware and password updates 
lower operational costs and improve operator efficiency.  A unified view of alarms 
in maps and allowing for customized salvo views enhances situational awareness. 
Automated operating procedure workflows reduce compliance costs and everyday 
operational costs.  Pro-Watch Integrated Security suite also reduces total cost of 
ownership by leveraging existing infrastructure
Additionally, Pro-Watch Integrated Security Suite uses data from the customer's 
system to provide proactive diagnostics – allowing the user to accurately budget for 
maintenance costs. Regional regulations create everyday challenges for security 
teams. By automating compliance, Pro-Watch reduces the risks of potential fines 
that could be levied for non-compliance. Automated workstreams allow the security 
operator to focus on daily needs, instead of on compliance activities. 
Pro-Watch Integrated Security Suite's flexible architecture achieves 24x7 
availability with the industry’s lowest installation and lifecycle costs. The user-
friendly design blends functional richness and configurability with an intuitive 
design requiring minimal operational training. Embedded system tours guide new 
operators through the basics of system operation, enabling them to be effective 
within 10 minutes – eliminating the need for costly on-site training. 
Situational awareness is a core concept in security systems. Pro-Watch Integrated 
Security Suite uses artificial intelligence to make sense of the mountain of data 
from multiple systems as it looks for abnormal situations. When detected, the 
location of the incident is represented on a building map and an incident workflow 
is created while SOP is executed. All actions related to an incident are archived for 
later analysis and packaged for external review. 
Pro-Watch delivers comprehensive options for audit and reporting to address 
forensics, compliance and business intelligence data mining needs.
PRO-WATCH® 5.5 
Integrated Security Suite
Honeywell Pro-Watch 5.5, part of the Pro-
Watch Integrated Security Suite  platform, 
provides robust, global integrated access 
control, video surveillance and intrusion 
detection in a single view to protect staff, 
property, optimize productivity and comply 
with strict industry regulations all while 
reducing operational costs.

ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS: 
PRO-WATCH ENTERPRISE 
EDITION
Pro-Watch Enterprise Edition (PWEE) 
provides a security solution for the global 
organization by sharing badge holder 
identities and event data across the 
organization.
With a PWEE system, an enterprise 
server facilitates two-way data sharing 
among regional servers. This enables 
single credential solutions across 
organizations.
If equipped with two or more Pro-
Watch Corporate Editions (PWCE), an 
organization may easily upgrade its 
servers to become part of an Enterprise 
system. Each corporate edition server 
becomes a regional server and retains 
regional system control.

	For a system to be considered small, the Pro-Watch system shall have less than five clients, no more than 128 online readers, less than 5000 historical events per day and proper database 
maintenance conducted by the end user or servicing dealer. For a system to be large, it must have between 5000 and 50,000 historical events per day, between 128 and 512 online readers, 
between 5 and 15 client workstations and proper database maintenance conducted by the end user or servicing dealer. If the system will have more than 50,000 events per day, exceed 512 
online readers, exceed 15 client workstations, or use Pro-Watch server side functions like anti-passback, event triggers and procedures, real time data transfer utility, HSDK, etc., please 
consult Honeywell for custom server sizing. 
2 
	RAID technology used for the larger system server – disk sets 1 and 2. When several physical disks are set up to use RAID technology, the operating system will be installed on a single disk 
(OS installed on RAID1 mirrored set) and the database and storage on a separate disk (RAID 5 or 10 disk set) 
3 
	To estimate database storage space, use the following approximations and add to the base database size of 500MB:
•	
Badgeholder storage = (number of badgeholders) x (75 KB)* estimate based on typical captured picture size
•	
Event history storage = (number of events per day) x (2.5 KB) x (number of days to retain in server)
•	
Audit history storage = [(number of cardholder changes per day) + (number of system configuration changes per day)+(number of events per day)+(number of operator system changes 
per day)]* (1.2 KB) x (number of days to retain in server)
4 
	Honeywell highly recommends some type of removable media for daily database backups. Database backups should be removed from the server and stored in a safe, secure location so in 
the event of system failure, this valuable data can be recovered. Honeywell recommends two or more removable media per server based upon end-user processes. Alternatively, Honeywell 
system installers can engage the end-users' IT group to participate in some type of network backup program.
•	
Important Notice – These server and workstation hardware guidelines are intended for use as a reference only. The specifications are subject to changes due to market conditions, 
software updates, manufacturing changes and other variables outside of our control. Honeywell recommends for planning based on system growth and expansion, operating system 
updates and upgrades, database engine updates and upgrades, end-user system expansion, historical data retention requirements and archive data storage requirements. Please 
consult with Honeywell as applicable for assistance.

components:
230-volt control units with single or dual volt-free 
output relays, rated to switch any type of load up to  10 
amps
low-voltage microwave detectors for surface or flush 
mounting, available in 15 and 30 metre versions
System design and installation is extremely simple, 
requiring no special tools or training.  Installation is 
confined to the lighting circuits being controlled. Detectors 
and control units may be combined to form self-contained 
controls or separated for more convenient electrical 
connection and commissioning. The low-voltage 
detectors do not contain any adjustment controls and 
may be fitted in public areas and at a height of up to 3.5m.  
Long Range LightSpot is a high performance presence 
detection system for use in almost any internal space. It 
was conceived to bring effective energy-saving control to 
large areas such as warehouses, sports halls, 
workshops, hangars, classrooms etc. The system offers 
many outstanding features and user options and is 
designed to the highest quality standards and 
performance criteria to ensure efficient and trouble-free 
operation.  When installed using the LRDKIT which is 
IP67 and IK08 rated, the LR30F can be used in the most 
exacting locations.

In larger areas it is often good practice for all or part of the 
load to be in semi-automatic operation, whereby a start 
button is provided to switch ON.   The load is 
automatically reset OFF once the area is vacated. This 
feature is useful where activation from adjacent spaces 
might occur or where the existing light level is adequate 
for visiting access. Dual-circuit control units allow for low-
level safety lighting to be provided automatically with the 
remaining load in semi-automatic operation.

Walk in and nothing happens until a start button is pressed. Lights then 
come ON and remain ON until the area is vacated and no movement 
has been detected for the selected interval.
Walk in and lights come ON. Lights go OFF automatically when the area 
is vacated and there has been no movement for the selected interval 
(usually 5 minutes).
Walk in and circuit 2 is activated. Circuit 1 will only come ON if the start 
button is pressed. When no movement has been detected for a 
selected interval, circuit 1 opens, followed, after a further delay, by 
circuit 2. The system resets to fully/semi-automatic operation.
Walk in and both circuits are activated. After no movement has been 
detected for a selected interval, circuit 1 opens, followed, after a further 
delay, by circuit 2.
This is an excellent way to provide lights very conveniently for all who 
need them without casual waste.
This is a convenient way to give safe through passage whilst retaining 
the advantages of semi-automatic operation.
This option is used when a sequenced shutdown is desirable, eg with 
SON lighting.
This is the routine application for areas where basically one type of 
activity takes place.
Modes of Operation
Positioning
The detector can see through glass and should be pointed away from thin partitions and windows which view spurious movement 
sources.
For operation in racking aisles, 
see 
Application Note: 
AN4010.
It is recommended that LR-type detectors be ceiling mounted but, if wall mounting is required, the wall mounting kit (WMK) must 
be used.
(Supplied assembled)
Horizontal installation
For general applications where ceiling mounting is not convenient 
and wide angle coverage in the horizontal plane is desirable.  The 
WMK can be screwed to a hard surface or the lid of a conduit stop-
end box.
Vertical installation
Use this method of mounting for racking aisle applications 
and where adjustment in the vertical plane will give improved 
control over the precise point of entry detection.
Examples of WMK application
LRDKIT - Rugged Installation Option
For more demanding locations, the LRDKIT (available separatelly) provides a robust IP67 and IK08 rated housing for the LR30F.  It 
allows the sensor to be mounted either horizontally or vertically, for ceiling or wall mounting, and to be rotated within different planes 
for optimal performance.

Standard Series LightSpot 
Standard Series LightSpot is a general purpose, fully-
automatic, directional presence detector with photocell.    
It saves energy by switching off lights in unoccupied areas 
and by holding lights off in occupied areas which have 
adequate natural light.  It uses a specially developed 
ultrasonic radar to monitor the controlled space for 
movement. This radar is sensitive enough to respond to 
even very small movements thus ensuring that lights are 
sustained whenever the controlled space is occupied.       
If no movement has been detected for a pre-selected 
period, LightSpot switches the lights off until the next 
visitor is detected.
Standard LightSpot with Photocell
The Standard LightSpot control features a movement 
detector, photocell and 10 Amp load switching element in 
one easily deployed housing.  LightSpot technology has 
been refined and improved over many years of efficient, 
reliable service in a wide range of industrial and 
commercial environments.  The latest designs use state-
of-the-art miniaturisation to pack the LightSpot's features 
into a small, attractive yet rugged enclosure which gives 
full field-of-view adjustment. Detectors are available for 
surface or semi-flush mounting.   
Adjustment Controls
Available for commissioning purposes, these are 
accessed via the side door.  The availability of two 
independent sensitivity controls makes the LightSpot 
supremely flexible in use.
ON Range is the normal range control which may be 
adjusted according to the needs of the space being 
controlled.
OFF Range sets the range once lights have been 
switched off and may, in some instances, require a 
different sensitivity setting.  A good example is a library or 
storage aisle which requires a high sensitivity when the 
aisle is occupied but a much lower sensitivity when the 
area becomes unoccupied so that traffic passing across 
the ends of an aisle will not activate the lights.
OFF Delay sets the time delay (after last detected 
movement) before lights are switched off.  Standard time-
out settings are 5-15 minutes in 5 minute increments with 
other times being available to special order.  A set-up time 
of 5 seconds is provided to assist rapid commissioning.
Power-up Condition.  The unit may be set to power-up, 
when mains power is first applied, with the load ON or 
OFF irrespective of occupancy or ambient light levels. 
Power-up OFF is useful where the use of stand-by 
generators, for example, makes it undesirable to have the 
full load activate at once.
Photocell.  The photocell is adjustable by a screw on the 
front grille.  The LightSpot photocell observes the 
controlled space, not just ambient daylight, and takes 
account of all light contributions - even from adjacent 
zones.  Photocell operation is extremely user-friendly: 
although the photocell takes into account light from the 
controlled luminaires themselves, it is configured never to 
switch lights off when anyone is present.  It will, however, 
hold lights off as people enter an already adequately lit 
area and bring lights on if lighting levels fall in an occupied 
area.

Standard Series LightSpots utilise ultrasonic 
radar to monitor a space for movement. This 
involves transmitting an ultrasound signal and 
examining the reflected signal for frequency 
variations called ""doppler shifts"". The transmitted 
signal is more quickly dissipated in open space 
and squeezed out by constraining walls and 
ceilings. The range of the detector also depends 
upon the type of movement being observed: for 
example, walking activity can be observed at a 
greater distance than the slight hand or body 
movement to be expected from a person 
working at a desk. Curve A (shaded) gives the 
free-space detection pattern for seated 
occupancy. Curve B, the free-space detection 
pattern for walking activity and Curve C the 
coverage in a corridor type application.  Note 
that LightSpot detectors can see behind 
themselves slightly so must be inset in a storage 
aisle or corridor application.

Technical Data
Note
The photocell is active in Scene 1 only.  When the 
ambient light level reaches the pre-set level, the 
photocell will hold off the lights as an area 
becomes occupied.  The photocell allows the 
lights to come on as the ambient light level drops 
but will not turn lights off in an occupied area.
This slimline flush detector is suitable for mounting into a suspended ceiling (or plasterboard when used 
with the PB64 Plasterboard Fixing Kit).

controlled by these detectors can be 
included in any of the six scenes in an ‘ON’ 
or ‘OFF’ state.  Scenes can be recalled with 
a single press of a button.  
Entry and Exit Scenes
The Entry Scene is automatically selected 
when the area becomes occupied.  Similarly, 
there is an option to select  an Exit Scene for 
when an area is vacated.

Commissioning of Lighting Scenes
Lighting scenes are set up using the infrared HC5A Hand-
held Controller.  The scene is set manually then stored by a 
long press on the selected scene button. New scenes can be 
set in this way without the need for separate programming 
devices.
Commissioning the Programmable Parameters
Operation of the system is determined by its commissioning. 
This is carried out using a menu-driven infrared remote 
programmer (QuickSet Pro) with virtually no disturbance to the 
building’s occupants.  Settings can be changed whenever 
required in the same way. The programmable parameters are 
shown overleaf; options for each parameter are selected from 
alternatives.
MLS Digital offers a flexible, user-responsive, building-wide 
control solution via a network of communicating detectors.  
Constant monitoring of occupancy and ambient light levels 
enables the system to automatically deliver optimum lighting 
conditions while effecting energy and cost savings.  
These MLS Luminaire Controllers may be integrated within 
luminaires with all makes of high-frequency regulating ballasts 
to provide individual luminaires with presence detection, daylight 
regulation/photocell control and full communication functions.  
 
There are two types of controller: the single unit 
MLS2000DI/DALI and the two-part MLSM2000D/DALI/A 
control module with DHW/S mini detector head (only the ultra-
discreet detector head is visible).

Regulating photocell ensures a minimum maintained 
light level, taking account of the contribution from 
adjacent luminaires and daylight.
Passive photocell holds lights off in bright ambient 
conditions. The choice of regulating, passive or none 
is available via Programmer on Analogue version.
Off delay: Period following the last observed 
movement after which the lights switch off.
Detection pattern and approximate range in metres 
at floor level for 2.5m mounting height (detection

For spans up to 20 feet, use eye bolts 
and plastic ties to anchor ends. For 
spans longer than 20 feet, use catenary 
cable (sold separately) with plastic ties 
at each socket.

Hanging Instructions
Light sockets must be suspended so that bulbs are facing down 
only. DO NOT MOUNT THE LIGHT STRINGS WITH SOCKETS 
FACING UPWARD!
Light string must be securely attached to a support structure 
at each end of each span. The maximum unsupported span 
distance for 48 foot Cord & Plug Light String is 20 feet (10 
sockets).
Secure light string to supporting hardware (eye bolts, brackets, 
etc - not included) using cable ties (not included).
Ensure any cut ends are properly sealed to prevent entrance of 
water 
For spans exceeding 20 feet, use properly rated cable support 
system and cable ties (neither are provided with light string) and 
follow local codes for suspended cables and loads.

Features
LED technology is ideal for commercial and retail lighting applications 
because of the many color choices, long life operation, and that LEDs 
do not emit any harmful UV rays that can fade artwork or fabrics. LEDs 
offer sparkle to applications with true crisp color temperature ranges 
to meet any architectural and design needs.

D’une apparente légèreté, les formes de Cercle & trait 
se frottent et se tiennent dans un jeu d’équilibre sa­
vamment dosé. Une suspension graphique déclinée en 
différentes finitions qui ne tient qu’à un fil.
As light as it looks, the forms of Cercle & trait rub together 
and hold together in a cleverly measured balance. A gra­
phic pendant, available in different finishes, is just held 
by one small wire.

Chacune des facettes met la matière en valeur. La sus­
pension, au design ovale et conique, peut accueillir trois

A light that is both minimalist and playful thanks to the 
technique of folding the material of brass.
Each of the facets really highlight the material. The pen­

Un cœur lumineux, serti d’un métal ajouré de manière 
extrêmement fine ou d’un disque plein, confère à cette 
collection une touche Art déco. Du clair-obscur au mou­
charabieh, les idées de composition sont variées.
This wall light, with an illuminated center, assembled with an 
extremely fine openwork or a fully covered piece of metal 
gives this collection an Art déco style. From semi-darkness

Derived from the ancient Greek ὑφ' ἕv  (huph' hén), Hyphen literally 
designates the union of two in one. The HYPHEN collection unites 
opposites and is available in several materials: warm, soft and 
sensitive porcelain is joined by cold, strong and shiny steel. Versatile, 
the luminaires can be pendant or free-standing.

Cé Petite Wall
Design by Alexandre Joncas
Cé audaciously blends a cascade of fringes with soft and 
pure curves. The use of anthropomorphism adds a human 
touch and evokes a presence in the room, while the fringes 
contrast their straight lines with the plush atmosphere 
created by the light they sift. Complete with abridged 
proportions and just as much charm as its big sister. All in 
all, this forms a fabulously coherent piece worthy of the 
most impressive spaces on Earth.

Cé Wall
Design by Alexandre Joncas
Cé audaciously blends fringes and metal, revealing a 
wellrounded wall mounted fixture. The unique movement 
of the fringes brings a fluid effect, distinguishing this 
piece from previous collections, all the while remaining 
faithful to the minimalist look of candid lines present 
in each of d’Armes creations. By dimming the light, the 
fringes create a plush atmosphere. Cé jostles the obvious 
association between fringes and lighting by unveiling a 
classic revisited.

ETAT-DES-LIEUX
Pendant Light
ETAT-DES-LIEUX
Design by Alexandre Joncas
Etat-des-Lieux, a contemporary lighting system defined by 
its variable silhouette, pays homage to the scenic Laurentian 
mountains and their majestic reflections in nearby waters. 
Engineered using innovative design and unique technical 
savvy, the timeless geometric installation inspired by the 
beauty of the landscape, is infused with precision and poetry.
Clean-lined and aesthetically spare, the versatile structure 
can be configured according to the demands of any space it 
inhabits, whether public or residential. Starting from a base 
foundation of one light point, Etat-des-Lieux can be arranged 
in countless ways, growing in space in any orientation, it can 
include multitudinous light modules to create a monumental 
and striking centrepiece.
Hollowed light points with soft rounded edges, available 
in five various mood-setting tints of glass, hang from flat 
straps that can be adjusted to the desired length. Playful and 
unconventional, it also allows for an orientation of the light 
beam, either up or down, setting a mystifying atmosphere.

Gigi is playful. Its lines are daring and its tones sensual. 
Under the breath of the glassblower, the unique shades 
and tones of the color spread throughout the material. 
It allows itself to be discovered, to be revealed in 
alternating opacity and transparency.
Gigi was the result of a professional love affair between 
Studio d’Armes and Verre d’Onge. This joint project is the 
alliance of two domains: the mastery of glass and of light. 
Its very existence emerges from a creative process focused 
on pleasure and an exploration of its physical nature, of 
the sensory experience of its presence in space, both in its 
table and floor version.
Gigi offers quality two-way lighting that fades to warmer 
shades to create a muted ambience in which it infuses a 
touch of playfulness, joy and softness.

Hartau Double
Design by Alexandre Joncas
The Hartau series brings together classical light fittings 
that are, at first glance, astonishing in their line and 
detail. They have been handmade in Canada using frosted 
glass, brass and painted aluminium.
The lampshades are the signature of this collection: with 
their two openings they offer both direct and indirect 
light to the wall or the ceiling. Each metal part of the 
Hartau collection is precision made in Quebec, Canada.

Hartau Simple
Design by Alexandre Joncas
The Hartau series brings together classical light fittings 
that are, at first glance, astonishing in their line and 
detail. They have been handmade in Canada using frosted 
glass, brass and painted aluminium.
The lampshades are the signature of this collection: with 
their two openings they offer both direct and indirect 
light to the wall or the ceiling. Each metal part of the 
Hartau collection is precision made in Quebec, Canada.

4.2.11 Hanging System Selection
The selection of a hanging system should not be taken lightly not only 
because it involves a significant portion of the erection labor, but also 
because an inadequate hanging system can be disastrous. In any multiple 
hanging system, the failure of one hanger transfers that load to adjacent 
hangers.  If one of these fail, an even greater load is transferred to the next. 
The result is a cascading failure in which an entire run of duct might fail.
There are many hanger alternatives, especially in the upper attachments. 
 
Besides structural adequacy, the contractor’s choice of hanging system 
must also take into account the particulars of the building structure, the 
skills of the workmen, the availability of tooling, and the recommendations 
of the fastener manufacturer. Because of these variables, it is suggested 
that the hanging system be the contractor’s choice, subject to the approval 
of the mechanical engineer.
DESCRIPTION
Rize 45° eyelets are manufactured of zinc plated cold rolled 
steel and swaged to the wire rope cable  with a hydraulic press. 
45° eyelet assemblies are available for installation with either 
a 1/4 in. or 3/8 in. fastener. They are also available both in 90° 
and straight assemblies, and as a kit with the appropriate cable 
lock.
For ordering information, see reverse side. 
WARNINGS 
ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE 
BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD: By pushing the adjustment pin in the opposite 
direction of the arrows on the cable lock and then pulling the cable also in the opposite 
direction of the arrows on the cable lock.
PULL ADJUSTMENT PIN BACK AND PASS WIRE ROPE THROUGH 
RIZE CABLE LOCK: Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated 
teeth and reduce holding capacity.
TO ENSURE HANGING SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND SAFETY: Use only Rize 
wire rope.
WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL) MUST FALL WITHIN THE STATED 
WORKING LOAD RANGE OF THE CABLE LOCK: Each product is load rated 
and incorporates a minimum safety factor of 5:1. This WLL takes into account the specification 
criteria of the Rize Cable Lock and the wire rope. 
DO NOT USE ON COATED WIRE ROPE: It is important to maintain the metal to 
metal contact between the locking pawls in the Kwik-Loc and the wire rope.
SPRAY PAINTING: of the Rize Suspension Hanging System after installation is accept-
able, at the installing contractor’s discretion, if the installing contractor physically confirms 
engagement of each cable lock on the cable prior to and after painting, and in strict accordance 
with the Rize Installation Instructions. Brush painting is not acceptable. Do not paint Cable or 
Cable Lock prior to installation. Do not reposition Cable Lock after painting.
DO NOT APPLY LUBRICANT: to any part of the assembly as this will alter the surface 
nature of the wire rope and attract dirt and debris.
DO NOT USE FOR LIFTING: (Under Hook slings) This product is designed for static 
load applications only.
KEEP THE PRODUCT CLEAN AND FREE FROM DIRT: Any dirt should be 
removed from the product prior to assembly.
INSPECT PERIODICALLY: Upon inspection, discard and replace if worn, 
distorted, or damaged.
REMOVE DAMAGED WIRE ENDS: Using a designated pair of wire rope cutters 
prior to inserting into the Rize Kwik-Loc.
WHEN INSTALLING RIZE KWIK-LOC CABLE ATTACHMENTS:  to 
buildings or equipment careful consideration must be made to the attachment method and 
the material being attached to. It is the responsibility of the installer for the proper selection, 
installation and appropriateness of the attachment to the job specifications and any codes. 
Rize can give general guidance, but any questions regarding this should ultimately be directed 
to the project engineer of the job.

Used in conjunction with the SKL200, the Cat Loc 
can be used to suspend lights and signs from a 
horizontal cable. This aesthetically pleasing system 
is fast and easy and will help you install lighting 
where no anchor points are available. 
 
Once the Cat Loc is installed on the horizontal cable 
you are able to move it and lock it in place at the 
ground level by twisting the cable. This saves time 
on the work site having to go back up to the unit to 
move and lock in place.
The Cat Loc has a working load of 75 lbs (34 kg) and 
is sold with the cable already attached to simplify 
installation. It is available in different lengths.

4.2.11 Hanging System Selection
The selection of a hanging system should not be taken lightly not only because 
it involves a significant portion of the erection labor, but also because an inad-
equate hanging system can be disastrous. In any multiple hanging system, the 
failure of one hanger transfers that load to adjacent hangers.  If one of these 
fail, an even greater load is transferred to the next.  The result is a cascading 
failure in which an entire run of duct might fail.
There are many hanger alternatives, especially in the upper attachments. 
Besides structural adequacy, the contractor’s choice of hanging system must 
also take into account the particulars of the building structure, the skills of the 
worker, the availability of tooling, and the recommendations of the fastener 
manufacturer. Because of these variables, it is suggested that the hanging 
system be the contractor’s choice, subject to the approval of the mechanical 
engineer.

FOR STATIC LOAD APPLICATIONS ONLY
USE ONLY RWC3 WIRE ROPE SUPPLIED BY 
RIZE ENTERPRISES WITH THE KL100 KWIK-LOC.
 Rize KL100 Kwik-Loc Assembly Instructions and Warnings
As a matter of sound engineering practice, 
the Rize Kwik-Loc assembly must be located 
no closer than 12 inches to the suspension 
point. In the case of round duct, where the 
wire rope encircles the duct, the Kwik-Loc 
must be located the distance of one diameter 
from the duct wall.
Adherence to these minimum clearances 
will distribute the load efficiently among all 
duct hanging components.
STANDARD ASSEMBLY
STEP 1 Pull the release pin back and thread the wire 
rope into one locking channel in the cable lock. Failure 
to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated 
teeth and reduce holding capacity.
STEP 2 Pass the wire rope “tail” through (or around) the 
anchor point (Eyehook, Beam, or Purlin).
STEP 3 Pull the second release pin back and push the 
wire rope tail into the second locking channel in the cable 
lock. Push through at least six inches.
STEP 4 Prior to the load being applied, the wire rope 
can be adjusted in either direction by sliding the release 
pin and moving the wire.
ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE 
LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD 
BY PUSHING THE ADJUSTMENT PIN IN THE 
OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS ON THE 
CABLE LOCK AND THEN PULLING THE CABLE, 
ALSO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE 
ARROWS ON THE CABLE LOCK.
Adjusting The Cable Lock
With the load off the wire rope and the Cable Lock, push 
the release pin in the direction of the arrow on the Cable 
Lock. This will release the locking pawl and allow the 
wire rope to be moved freely in either direction. (After a 
load has been applied it may be necessary to pull the cable 
slightly to disengage the teeth on the pawl). Be sure the 
load is fully supported before attempting an adjustment.
KL100
Leave at least 
a 6” tail on all 
wire ends.

http://rizellc.com/techsupport-testing.html
WARNINGS 
ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD: By pushing the adjustment pin in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock 
and then pulling the cable also in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock.
PULL ADJUSTMENT PIN BACK AND PASS WIRE ROPE THROUGH RIZE KWIK-LOC: Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity.
TO ENSURE HANGING SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND SAFETY: Use only Rize wire rope.
WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL) MUST FALL WITHIN THE STATED WORKING LOAD RANGE OF THE KWIK-LOC: Each product is load rated and incorporates a minimum safety factor 
of 5:1. This WLL takes into account the specification criteria of the Rize Kwik-Loc and the wire rope. 
DO NOT USE ON COATED WIRE ROPE: It is important to maintain the metal to metal contact between the locking pawls in the Kwik-Loc and the wire rope.
SPRAY PAINTING: of the Rize Suspension Hanging System after installation is acceptable, at the installing contractor’s discretion, if the installing contractor physically confirms engagement of each cable lock on the cable 
prior to and after painting, and in strict accordance with the Rize Installation Instructions. Brush painting is not acceptable. Do not paint Cable or Cable Lock prior to installation. Do not reposition Cable Lock after painting.
DO NOT APPLY LUBRICANT: to any part of the assembly as this will alter the surface nature of the wire rope and attract dirt and debris.
DO NOT USE FOR LIFTING: (Under Hook slings) This product is designed for static load applications only.
KEEP THE PRODUCT CLEAN AND FREE FROM DIRT: Any dirt should be removed from the product prior to assembly.
INSPECT PERIODICALLY: Upon inspection, discard and replace if worn, distorted, or damaged.
REMOVE DAMAGED WIRE ENDS: Using a designated pair of wire rope cutters prior to inserting into the Rize Kwik-Loc.
WHEN INSTALLING RIZE KWIK-LOC CABLE ATTACHMENTS:  to buildings or equipment careful consideration must be made to the attachment 
method and the material being attached to. It is the responsibility of the installer for the proper selection, installation and appropriateness of the attachment to the 
job specifications and any codes. Rize can give general guidance, but any questions regarding this should ultimately be directed to the project engineer of the job.

Com experiência de mais de 30 anos em proteção de 
caldeiras, a tecnologia Unifuse® WSI responde a esta 
necessidade oferecendo proteção de superfície ideal para 
resíduos de caldeiras de energia, caldeiras de biomassa, 
caldeiras a carvão, caldeiras de recuperação de lixivia 
negra, fornos e capuzes na produção de aço, tal como 
Fornos a Arco Elétrico (EAF) e Fornos a Oxigênio (BOF).
Unifuse é uma solução de engenharia econômica contra 
ataques de corrosão/erosão de produtos de combustão 
em caldeiras e da corrente quente do gás de combustão 
de escape em sistemas de recuperação de calor. Unifuse 
prolonga a vida operacional dos tubos e dos painéis tubo-
tubo, evitando assim ou retardando custosas substituições.
Tecnologia Unifuse
Normas e códigos rigorosos, como os códigos de EN e ASME, governam os requisitos 
de resistência para projeto e construção de caldeiras. A maioria destes componentes 
têm uma espessura de parede inicial com tolerância para corrosão, mas as condições 
operacionais e o ambiente em torno podem resultar em desgaste excessivo. Isso 
pode levar as caldeiras a não operar economicamente sem a proteção de superfície 
adequada contra corrosão, erosão e até trincas.
Unifuse prolonga 
a vida operacional 
dos tubos e dos 
painéis tubo-tubo, 
evitando assim 
ou retardando 
custosas 
substituições.
Serviços de caldeiras
É crucial determinar qual tipo de processo danoso está 
afetando o ativo. Proteção com solda de revestimento 
pode desgastar-se com o passar do tempo, sua 
longevidade depende não só da qualidade da aplicação, 
mas também das condições operacionais dentro 
da caldeira Temperatura extremamente localizada, 
turbulência, choque de gases de combustão, e as cinzas 
podem causar uma redução na vida útil do revestimento. 
Unifuse proporciona a melhor qualidade com a menor 
diluição possível se usado no processo de construção 
para alcançar a recuperação da espessura mínima 
(assegurando a restauração da pressão na parede) ou se 
aplicado como um revestimento resistente à corrosão, 
permitindo que a caldeira opere de forma mais rentável.

Auditoria pré-trabalho 
Durante a fase de avaliação do projeto, realizamos uma visita pré-trabalho 
para assegurar que nosso pessoal e procedimentos estão em conformidade 
com os requisitos dos clientes sobre saúde, segurança e meio-ambiente e 
garantia de qualidade.
Iremos determinar, através de vários testes, se existe a necessidade da 
construção do tubo, um reparo específico para restaurar o limite da pressão, 
ou se a caldeira pode ser diretamente revestida.
Preparação da superfície
Antes do revestimento, nosso Inspetor de Qualidade nível 2 e/ou nível 3 irá 
inspecionar a superfície jateada (SA 3), determinar a espessura e identificar 
defeitos.
As superfícies devem estar livres de qualquer possível contaminação tal como 
refratário, revestimentos ou Inconel velho. Se houver um revestimento que 
foi aplicado anteriormente, a superfície deve ser esmerilhada para eliminar 
todos os possíveis defeitos, tal como poros. Todos os defeitos visíveis serão 
reparados durante este estágio.
Processo Unifuse
Isso é realizado no modo vertical descendente da membrana para a seção 
do tubo, seguindo uma sequência de cordões de solda pré-programada para 
alcançar uma cobertura uniforme e suave. Cada cordão de solda é sobreposto 
por um cordão subsequente para garantir cobertura total com um revestimento 
de espessura de 2 mm. Se a espessura do tubo está abaixo do nível mínimo para 
revestimento, ou seja, 2.2 mm para vertical e 2.5 mm para não vertical, então 
uma construção de aço carbono é requerida antes do revestimento.
Inspeção
Nossos inspetores produzem um relatório detalhado do revestimento 
realizado, o qual inclui os seguintes Ensaios Não Destrutivos (END).
 
∞Ensaio por Ultrassom (UT) e Visual (VT) antes do revestimento
 
∞Ensaios aleatórios durante a aplicação do revestimento
 
∞Identificação Positiva de Materais (PMI), Líquido Penetrante (LP), UT, e VT após a 
conclusão do revestimento.
Soldagem de revestimento  
automatizada on site
Além da nossa oficina de fabricação, nós também realizamos reparos e upgrades 
no local Condições operacionais específicas que afetam a caldeira podem causar o 
desgaste do revestimento de proteção, resultando em desgaste excessivo, neste caso 
podemos realizar o reparo necessário no local. Podemos aplicar solda de revestimento 
em tubos de aço carbono novos ou desgastados e também podemos reaplicar o 
revestimento em cima de um revestimento antigo, como Inconel®.

Resíduo para caldeiras de  
Energia e Biomassa
Gerenciar problemas de corrosão relacionados com caldeiras que queimam resíduos 
sólidos urbanos e combustível a partir de materiais orgânicos é um grande desafio para 
os operadores.
Reparo de uma parede tubo-tubo em uma Unidade de Energia de Residuos
 
Resíduo para caldeira de energia 
Resíduo sólido urbano é um combustível heterogêneo 
que contém inúmeras impurezas tal como, cloro, enxofre, 
sódio, zinco, chumbo, e outros metais pesados. Durante 
a combustão do combustível, estas impurezas geram um 
ambiente corrosivo que reduz a vida do aço carbono. 
Isso geralmente pode acarretar à falha do tubo e 
consequentemente uma custosa parada não programada 
da caldeira. A atmosfera corrosiva afeta os tubos da 
caldeira, parede tubo-tubo, tubos superheater, fornos, 
bancos de caldeiras e economizadores.
Caldeira de Biomassa
Caldeiras de Biomassa usam combustível de materiais 
orgânicos tal como resíduo da agricultura, resíduos 
de plantas e florestais, culturas energéticas e madeira 
recuperada que pode ser misturado com resíduo urbano. 
Estes combustíveis geralmente contêm quantidades 
significantes de elementos tais como cloro, potássio, 
álcalis, sódio, enxofre, chumbo e zinco.
O processo de combustão libera gases de combustão 
que contêm compostos de baixo ponto de fusão que 
causam corrosão e também formam depósitos que se 
fundem na superfície do tubo superheater e limitam a 
taxa de transferência de calor para o vapor nos tubos.
Solda Unifuse com a liga 625
Para uma caldeira operar nestas severas condições durante 
um extenso período de anos, os tubos requerem uma 
camada de proteção contra corrosão. Unifuse® com a liga 
625 (não se limitando), tem se mostrado ser a solução 
mais rentável para ataques corrosivos de produtos de 
combustão em caldeiras e de gases de combustão quentes 
em sistemas de recuperação de calor de resíduos e para 
manter a integridade estrutural da parede tubo-tubo.
É a escolha dos operadores para maximizar os benefícios 
econômicos de maior vida útil, para evitar paradas 
imprevistas, e para evitar custos de manutenção durante a 
próxima parada.

Serviços de caldeiras
 
Enxofre, a principal impureza no carvão, quando 
queimado libera SOx que resulta em problemas 
tal como corrosão de alta temperatura. Depois 
da combustão, a cinza do carvão pode ser 
arrastada no gás de combustão e causar erosão 
por cinza volante nas superfícies de absorção 
de calor tais como tubos de fornos, leitos 
fluidizados, superheaters e economizadores. 
Problemas de escorificação devido ao depósito 
de cinza nas paredes do forno podem causar 
problemas de incrustação. Métodos de 
remoção de cinza (com vapor, hidrojato ou 
canhão d’água) também podem ocasionar uma 
maior corrosão/erosão e fadiga térmica.
 
Superheaters normalmente são feitos de aço 
carbono ou Cr-Mo (por exemplo, Aço Ferrítico: 
T11, T22). Rápida corrosão de alta temperatura 
destes tubos de aço pode ocorrer onde há 
áreas de alta temperatura. A combustão da 
lixivia gera um fundido inorgânico que é rico 
em carbonato de sódio (Na2CO3) e sulfeto de 
sódio (Na2S). Sua combustão causa desgaste 
na parede do tubo devido à sulfetação em 
carbonatos do aço carbono, sulfetos e sais 
de potássio também podem depositar-se nos 
tubos, no piso nas aberturas de inspeção e 
causar ainda mais corrosão.
Caldeiras a carvão
Caldeira de recuperação de  
lixivia negra
A industrial mundial de carvão tem sido alvo de uma série de regulamentações, 
mudanças na economia e o aumento da extração de gás de xisto. Esta tendência 
recentrou a Europa como o maior comprador de carvão de alto teor de enxofre.
A caldeira de recuperação de lixivia negra é um dos processos mais críticos na área de 
papel e celulose e o aumento da corrosão dos tubos superheaters é bastante afetada 
por fatores de operação da caldeira, tal como a temperatura.

wie Druckgeräten ist für Sicherheit, 
Kapitalrendite und betriebliche 
Zuverlässigkeit von hoher Wichtigkeit. 
Prozessveränderungen können die 
bestehende Anlage beeinträchtigen und die 
Korrosion fördern. Eine Umrüstung auf
fortschrittlichere Technologie bewahrt die 
mechanische Integrität und gewährleistet 
eine hohe Zuverlässigkeit.
Wartungskosten senken
Langfristige Reparaturen anstelle des 
Austauschs vorhandener Rohrwände 
bedeuten unter Umständen weniger 
Wartung. Wir haben die Kapazität, um auf 
kurze Vorlaufzeiten und enge Zeitpläne zu 
reagieren.

Mit mehr als 30 Jahren Erfahrung im Kesselschutz 
erfüllt die Unifuse®-Technologie von WSI diese 
Anforderungen durch die Bereitstellung eines optimalen 
Oberflächenschutzes für Kessel zur Energieerzeugung 
aus Abfall, Biomasse-Kessel, kohlebefeuerte Kessel, 
Kessel zur Rückgewinnung von Schwarzlauge sowie Öfen 
und Hauben in der Stahlfertigung, wie Lichtbogenöfen 
(„Electric Arc Furnace“ (EAF)) und Sauerstoff-
Aufblasskonverter („Basic Oxygen Furnaces“ – (BOF)).
Unifuse ist eine kostengünstig gestaltete Lösung 
zum Schutz vor Korrosion/Erosion, die durch die 
Verbrennungsprodukte in den Kesseln sowie durch 
den Abgasstrom in Abwärmerückgewinnungssystemen 
verursacht wird. Unifuse verlängert die Gebrauchsdauer 
von Rohren und (Wasser)Rohrwänden, so dass teure 
Austauscharbeiten vermieden oder hinausgezögert werden.
Unifuse Technologie
Die Entwicklung und Konstruktion von Kesseln ist durch strenge Normen und 
Vorgaben wie die EN- und ASME-Vorschriften geregelt. Bei den meisten dieser 
Komponenten ist in der ursprünglichen Wanddicke ein Aufmaß für die Korrosion 
berücksichtigt. Allerdings können die jeweiligen Betriebsbedingungen und die direkte 
Umgebung zu übermäßigem Verschleiß führen. Das kann zur Folge haben, dass die 
Kessel nicht wirtschaftlich arbeiten, wenn sie keinen geeigneten Oberflächenschutz 
gegen Korrosion, Erosion oder gar Rissbildung haben.

Es ist wichtig, herauszufinden, durch welchen Prozess 
die Anlage beschädigt wird. Auftragschweißschutz kann 
sich mit der Zeit abnutzen, und seine Langlebigkeit 
wird nicht nur von der Qualität der Anwendung, 
sondern auch von den Betriebsbedingungen des 
Kessels beeinflusst. Stark lokalisierte Auswirkungen 
von Temperaturen, Verwirbelung und das Auftreffen 
von Abgas und Asche können die Lebensdauer der 
Auftragsschweißschicht verkürzen. Unifuse bietet höchste 
Qualität bei geringstmöglicher Aufmischung, ganz 
gleich, ob es zum Materialaufbau eingesetzt wird, um 
eine minimale Wanddicke wieder herzustellen (und so 
die Wiederherstellung der Druckwand sicherzustellen), 
oder als korrosionsbeständige Auftragsschicht, damit der 
Kessel möglichst kosteneffizient arbeitet.

Prüfung vor der Auftragschweißung 
Während der Evaluierungsphase des Projekts führen wir eine Begehung 
durch, um sicherzustellen, dass unser Personal und unsere Verfahren die 
Kundenanforderungen hinsichtlich Gesundheit, Sicherheit und Umwelt sowie 
Qualitätssicherung erfüllen. Anhand verschiedener Tests wird bestimmt, ob ein 
Neuaufbau von Rohren oder spezielle Reparaturen zur Wiederherstellung der 
Druckgrenze erforderlich sind oder ob der Kessel direkt verkleidet werden kann.
Vorbereitung der Oberfläche
Vor der Auftragschweißung prüfen unsere Qualitätsprüfer der Stufe II und/oder 
Stufe III die beschädigte Oberfläche (SA 3), bestimmen die Dicke und decken 
Mängel auf. Die Oberflächen müssen frei sein von jeglichen Verschmutzungen 
wie feuerfesten Stoffen, Beschichtungen oder altem Inconel. Wenn eine 
zuvor aufgetragene Auftragschweißschicht vorhanden ist, muss die Fläche 
abgeschliffen werden, um alle möglichen Mängel (z. B. Poren) zu eliminieren. 
Alle sichtbaren Mängel werden in dieser Phase behoben.
Unifuse-Verfahren
Dies erfolgt nach einer vorprogrammierten Schweißraupensequenz in 
vertikaler Richtung von der Membran abwärts zum Rohrabschnitt, um eine 
gleichmäßige Abdeckung und eine glatte Oberfläche zu erreichen. Jede 
Schweißraupe wird durch eine folgende Schweißraupe überlappt, um eine 
vollständige Abdeckung mit einer 2 mm dicken Schicht sicherzustellen. 
Wenn die Rohrdicke geringer ist als das Mindestmaß für eine Bedeckung, d. 
h. 2,2 mm vertikal und 2,5 mm horizontal, ist ein Neuaufbau des C-Stahls 
erforderlich, ehe das Auftragschweißen erfolgt.
Inspektion
Die durchgeführte Beschichtung wird in einem umfassenden Bericht 
festgehalten. Dieser umfasst folgende Punkte: zerstörungsfreie Prüfungen ( ZfP),
 
∞Ultraschalltests (UT) und Sichtprüfungen (VT) vor dem Auftragen
 
∞Stichprobenartige Tests während des Auftragschweißens
 
∞Positive Materialidentifikation (PMI), Eindringprüfungen (PT), UT und VT nach Abschluss

Auftragschweißarbeiten vor Ort
Neben unserer Fertigungswerkstatt können wir auch vor Ort Reparaturen und 
Umrüstungen durchführen. Spezielle Betriebsbedingungen, die auf den Kessel wirken, 
können zu einer Alterung der schützenden Auftragschweißschicht und somit zu 
verstärktem Verschleiß führen. In solchen Fällen können die erforderlichen Reparaturen 
vor Ort durchgeführt werden. Wir können Auftragschweißarbeiten an neuen oder 
verschlissenen Rohren aus Kohlenstoffstahl durchführen oder auch eine neue 
Auftragschweißschicht auf eine alte (wie Inconel) auftragen.

Kessel zur Energieerzeugung 
aus Abfall und Biomasse
Die Bewältigung von Korrosionsproblemen in Verbindung mit Kesseln, die 
Siedlungsabfälle und Brennmaterial aus organischem Material verbrennen, ist für die 
Betreiber eine der größten Herausforderungen.
Rohrwandreparatur in einer Müllverbrennungsanlage
 
Müllverbrennungskessel 
Siedlungsabfälle sind ein heterogenes Brennmaterial, 
das zahlreiche Verunreinigungen enthält, z. B. Chlor, 
Schwefel, Natrium, Zink, Blei und andere Schwermetalle. 
Bei der Verbrennung bilden diese Verunreinigungen 
eine korrosive Atmosphäre, die die Lebensdauer des 
Kohlenstoffstahls verkürzt. Dies führt oft zu Defekten der 
Rohre und damit zu teuren, ungeplanten Abschaltungen 
der Kessel. Die korrosive Atmosphäre kann sich auf 
die Kesselrohre, Rohrwände, Überhitzerrohre, Öfen, 
Kesselkästen und Vorwärmer auswirken.
Biomasse-Kessel
Biomasse-Kessel nutzen Brennstoffe von organischen 
Materialien wie landwirtschaftlichen Abfällen, Wald- 
und Pflanzenresten, Energiepflanzen sowie RT-
Späne (zurückgewonnene Holzbrennstoffe), die mit 
Stadtabfällen gemischt werden können. Diese Brennstoffe 
enthalten oft hohe Mengen von Elementen wie Chlor, 
Kalium, Alkali, Natrium, Schwefel, Blei oder Zink. Beim 
Verbrennungsprozess werden Brennstoffgase freigesetzt, 
die Bestandteile mit niedriger Schmelztemperatur enthalten. 
Diese können Korrosion verursachen und Ablagerungen 
bilden, die an der Oberfläche des Überhitzerrohres 
schmelzen und die Rate der Wärmeübertragung in den 
Dampf in den Rohren begrenzen.
Unifuse-Auftragschweißen mit Alloy 625
Damit ein Kessel unter diesen harschen Bedingungen über 
mehrere Jahre hinweg funktionieren kann, müssen die 
Rohre mit Hilfe einer Schutzschicht vor Korrosion bewahrt 
werden. Unifuse® mit Alloy 625 hat sich als kostengünstigste 
Lösung für Korrosionsangriffe von Verbrennungsprodukten 
in Kesseln und von heißen Abgasströmen in 
Abwärmerückgewinnungssystemen erwiesen und erhält 
die strukturelle Integrität der Rohrwände. Es ist die richtige 
Wahl für Kesselbetreiber, die die wirtschaftlichen Vorteile 
einer längeren Lebensdauer maximieren, unvorhergesehene 
Abschaltungen verhindern und Wartungskosten beim 
nächsten Ausfall umgehen wollen.

Schwefel, die stärkste Verunreinigung in  
Kohle, verursacht beim Verbrennen  
SOx-Emissionen, die zu Problemen wie zum 
Beispiel Hochtemperaturkorrosion führen. 
Nach dem Verbrennen kann die Asche der 
Kohle im Abgas mittransportiert werden und 
so Flugascheerosion an wärmeabsorbierenden 
Oberflächen wie den Rohren der 
Rohrwände von Öfen, Wirbelschichten, 
Überhitzern und Vorwärmern verursachen. 
Verschlackungsprobleme aufgrund von 
Ascheablagerungen an Ofenwänden können 
zu Ablagerungen führen. Methoden zum 
Entfernen von Asche (mit Dampf, Wasserlanzen 
oder Wasserkanonen) können zu zusätzlicher 
Korrosion/Erosion und thermischer Ermüdung 
führen.
 
Überhitzer bestehen üblicherweise aus 
Kohlenstoffstahl oder Cr-Mo-Stählen (z. 
B. ferritischem Stahl: T11, T22). Schnelle 
Hochtemperaturkorrosion kann bei diesen 
Stahlrohren in Bereichen mit großer Hitze 
auftreten. Bei der Verbrennung der Flüssigkeit 
entsteht eine anorganische Schmelze mit 
einem hohen Anteil an Natriumkarbonat 
(Na2CO3) und Natriumsulfit (Na2S). Bei 
Kohlenstoffstahl führt die Verbrennung 
aufgrund der Sulfidierung zu einer Verdünnung 
der Rohrwand. Zudem können sich Karbonate, 
Sulfide und Kaliumsalze an den Rohren, 
auf dem Boden, der Ausgusswand sowie 
Blasauslässen ablagern und weitere Korrosion 
verursachen.
Kohlebefeuerte Kessel
Kessel zur Rückgewinnung 
von Schwarzlauge
Die weltweite Kohleindustrie ist unzähligen Vorschriften, wirtschaftlichen Veränderungen 
und dem zunehmenden Gewinn von Gas aus Schieferfelsformationen unterworfen. 
Durch diese Tendenz ist Europa wieder als Hauptkäufer der hochschwefelhaltigen 
korrosiven Kohle in den Fokus gerückt.
Der Kessel zur Rückgewinnung von Schwarzlauge ist eines der wichtigsten 
Prozesssysteme in Holzstoff- und Papierfabriken, und die zunehmende Korrosion in 
den Überhitzerrohren wird in hohem Maße durch Faktoren des Kesselbetriebs wie u.a. 
die Temperatur beeinflusst.

WSI wurde schon oft beauftragt, Unifuse® 622  
Metall-Auftragschweißarbeiten für kohlebefeuerte Kessel 
durchzuführen. Unifuse mit Alloy 622 hat sich gegen Korrosion, 
Korrosion/Erosion sowie thermische Ermüdung bewährt und ist 
besonders effektiv als Korrosionsschutz für Rohrwände unter 
Bedingungen der Verbrennung mit wenig NOx.
Unifuse-Auftragschweißarbeiten mit 
Legierung 309, 310 und GR383
Rohre die mit Unifuse mit Legierung 309, 310 oder GR383 anhand 
des von WSI patentierten MSG-/WIG-Schweißverfahrens geschützt 
sind, stellen eine kostengünstige und langfristige Lösung für das 
Problem der Korrosion von Überhitzern dar. Gleichzeitig entfällt die 
Notwendigkeit für das Schweißen ungleicher Metalle.

With over 30 years’ experience in boiler protection, WSI’s 
Unifuse® technology answers this need by providing 
optimal surface protection for waste to energy boilers, 
biomass boilers, coal-fired boilers, black liquor recovery 
boilers, and furnaces and hoods in steel manufacturing, 
such as Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) and Basic Oxygen 
Furnaces (BOF).
Unifuse is a cost-effective engineered solution against 
corrosion/erosion attacks from combustion products in 
boilers and from the hot, exhaust flue gas stream in waste 
heat recovery systems. Unifuse extends the operational 
life of tubes and waterwall panels, thus avoiding or 
delaying costly replacements.
Unifuse technology
Strict standards and codes, such as the EN and ASME codes, govern the strength 
requirements for the design and construction of boilers. Most of these components 
have a corrosion allowance built into their initial wall thickness but operational 
conditions and the surrounding environment can result in excessive wear. This can 
lead to boilers not operating economically without the proper surface protection 
against corrosion, erosion and even cracking.
Unifuse extends the 
operational life of 
tubes and waterwall 
panels, and avoids 
or delays costly 
replacements
Boiler Services
It is crucial to determine what kind of damaging process 
is affecting the asset. Weld overlay protection can wear 
down as time goes by and its longevity depends not 
only on the quality of the application but also on the 
operational conditions within the boiler. Highly localized 
temperature, turbulence, flue gas impingement, and 
ash may cause a reduction in the overlay service life. 
Unifuse delivers the best quality with the lowest dilution 
possible whether used in the build-up process to achieve 
minimum thickness recovery (assuring the restoration 
of the pressure wall) or whether applied as a corrosion-
resistant overlay, allowing the boiler to operate in the 
most cost-effective way.

Pre-job audit 
During the evaluation phase of the project, we perform a pre-job visit to be 
sure our personnel and procedures comply with the customers’ requirements 
on Health, Safety and Environment and Quality Assurance.
We will determine, through various tests, whether there is a need for tube 
build-up, a specific repair to restore the pressure boundary, or if the boiler can 
be directly overlaid.
Surface preparation
Prior to the overlay, our level II and/or level III Quality Inspectors will inspect 
the blasted surface (SA 3), determine the thickness and identify defects.
Surfaces must be free from any possible contamination such as refractory, 
coatings or old inconel. If there is previous weld overlay applied, the surface 
must be ground-off to eliminate all possible defects such as pores. All visible 
defects will be repaired during this stage.
Unifuse process
This is carried out in the vertical down mode from the membrane to the 
tube section, following a pre-programmed weld bead sequence to achieve 
uniform coverage and a smooth surface. Each weld bead is overlapped by a 
subsequent weld bead to ensure full coverage with a 2 mm-thick overlay.
If the tube thickness is below the minimum level for overlay, ie 2.2 mm vertical 
and 2.5 mm in non-vertical then carbon steel build-up is required prior to  
weld overlay.
Inspection
Our inspectors produce a comprehensive report of the overlay carried out, 
which includes the following Non-destructive Testing (NDT)
 
∞Ultrasonic Testing (UT) and Visual Testing (VT) prior to overlay
 
∞Random testing during overlay application
 
∞Positive Material Identification (PMI), Penetrant Testing (PT), 
UT, and VT after completion of the overlay
Automated weld overlay on site
In addition to our fabrication shop, we also perform repairs and upgrades on site. 
Specific operating conditions affecting the boiler can cause aging of the protective 
weld overlay, resulting in excessive wear, in which case we can perform the necessary 
repairs on site. We can apply weld overlay on new or worn carbon steel tubes and we 
can also re-apply weld overlay on top of old overlay such as inconel.

Waste to Energy and  
Biomass boilers
Managing corrosion issues related to boilers burning municipal solid waste and burning 
fuel from organic materials is a major challenge for operators.
Waterwall repair at an Energy from Waste facility
 
Waste to Energy boilers 
Municipal solid waste is a heterogeneous fuel that 
contains numerous impurities such as chlorine, sulfur, 
sodium, zinc, lead, and other heavy metals. During 
fuel combustion, these impurities generate a corrosive 
environment which reduces the life of carbon steel. This 
can often lead to tube failure and consequently costly 
unscheduled shutdown of the boiler. The corrosive 
atmosphere affects boiler tubes, waterwalls, superheater 
tubes, furnaces, boiler banks and economizers.
Biomass boilers
Biomass boilers use fuel from organic materials such as 
agricultural wastes, forest and plant residuals, energy 
crops, and RT chips (recovered wood fuel) that can be 
mixed with municipal waste. These fuels often contain 
significant amounts of elements such as chlorine, 
potassium, alkali, sodium, sulfur, lead or zinc.
The combustion process releases flue gases containing 
low-melting temperature compounds that cause 
corrosion and also form deposits that melt on the 
superheater tube surface and limit the rate of heat 
transfer to the steam in the tubes.
Unifuse weld overlay with alloy 625
For a boiler to operate in these harsh conditions over 
an extended period of years, the tubes require a layer 
to protect against corrosion. Unifuse® with alloy 625 
(not limited to) has proven to be the most cost-effective 
solution to corrosion attacks from combustion products 
in boilers and from hot, exhaust flue gas streams in waste 
heat recovery systems, and to maintain the structural 
integrity of the waterwalls.
It is the choice of boiler operators to maximize the 
economic benefits of longer service life, to prevent the 
unforeseen shutdown, and to avoid maintenance costs 
during the next outage.
8
 
Sulfur, the main impurity in coal, when burned causes SOx emission 
resulting in problems such as high-temperature corrosion. After 
combustion, the ash from the coal can be entrained in flue gas and 
cause fly ash erosion on heat-absorbing surfaces such as furnace 
waterwall tubes, fluidized beds, superheaters and economizers. 
Slagging problems due to ash deposits on furnace walls may cause 
fouling issues. Ash removal methods (with steam, waterlances or 
water cannons) may also lead to further corrosion/erosion and 
thermal fatigue.
Unifuse weld overlay with alloy 622
WSI has been selected to provide weld metal overlay on many 
coal-fired boilers using Unifuse® 622. Unifuse with alloy 622 has a 
proven performance record against corrosion, corrosion/erosion 
and thermal fatigue, and is especially effective in providing corrosion 
protection for waterwalls under low NOx combustion conditions.
 
Superheaters are typically made of carbon or Cr-Mo steels (e.g. 
ferritic steel: T11, T22). Rapid, high-temperature corrosion of these 
steel tubes can occur where there are high-heat areas. Combustion 
of the liquor yields an inorganic smelt which is rich in sodium 
carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium sulfide (Na2S). Its combustion 
generates tube-wall thinning due to sulfidation in carbon steel 
carbonates and sulfides. Potassium salts may also deposit on tubes, 
smelt run floor, spout wall and primary airport openings and cause 
further corrosion.
Unifuse weld overlay with alloy 309, 310  
and GR383
Tubes protected with Unifuse with alloy 309, 310 or GR383, using 
the WSI patented GMAW/GTAW process, are a cost-effective,  
long-term solution to the superheater corrosion problem while  
also eliminating the need for dissimilar metal welds. 
Coal-fired boilers
Black liquor recovery boilers
The global coal industry has been subject to a host of regulations, changes in 
economics and the increase in extracting gas from shale-rock formations. This trend 
has refocused Europe now as the major buyer of the high-sulfur corrosive coal.
The black liquor recovery boiler is one of the most critical process systems in wood 
pulp and paper mills and the increase of corrosion in the superheater tubes is greatly 
affected by boiler operating factors, such as temperature.

A tailored maintenance program is the most cost-effective way to 
protect your asset. During the maintenance program, we monitor 
the performance of your assets on a regular basis.
By using regular inspection of the existing overlay we are able to 
provide a dedicated customer report with detailed information on 
the status of the overlay and advise on the most effective repair and 
an indication of life expectancy.
In the case of exposure of base metal, spot repairs to the overlay 
will be applied after surface preparation of the area. In the event  
of larger repairs being required, WSI can offer a repair solution  
using the Unifuse® technology that has been successfully proven 
in boiler applications for more than thirty years and provides a cost 
effective solution to corrosion attack from combustion products 
in boilers and from the hot, exhaust flue gas stream in waste heat 
recovery systems.
Warranties
Our services guarantee accurate adherence of the protection to 
the tubes and flat bar membranes that have been applied with the 
corrosion-resistant alloy. Warranties from the date the overlay will 
be exposed to fire/flue gas can be supplied. These warranties are 
subject to agreement following receipt of the overlay parameters to 
which the overlay is exposed. Our evaluation takes account of all the 
relevant operational factors such as boiler type, flue characteristics, 
boiler operation conditions, and current tube conditions.
The WSI boiler maintenance 
program
Changes in operations, or fuel type, can result in increased degradation of pressure 
parts and reduced performance; ignoring the maintenance of these valuable assets  
can lead to expensive repair or replacement.

Con más de 30 años de experiencia en la protección 
de calderas, la tecnología Unifuse® de WSI responde a 
esta necesidad, ofreciendo una protección óptima de la 
superficie de calderas de incineración de residuos, de 
biomasa, de carbón, de recuperación y de altos hornos y 
campanas para la fabricación de acero, como los hornos 
de arco eléctrico (EAF) y los hornos básicos de oxígeno 
(BOF).
Unifuse es una solución de ingeniería rentable contra los 
ataques de la erosión y la corrosión de los productos de 
la combustión en las calderas y de los gases de escape 
calientes que generan los sistemas de recuperación del 
calor residual. Unifuse prolonga la vida útil de los tubos y 
los paneles de las paredes de agua, con lo cual se evitan o 
se retrasan costosas sustituciones.
Tecnología Unifuse
El diseño y la construcción de calderas se rigen por unos estrictos estándares y 
códigos (p. ej., EN y ASME) que establecen unos exigentes requisitos. La mayoría de 
estos componentes tiene un margen de corrosión permisible en el espesor inicial de 
su pared, pero las condiciones operativas y el entorno pueden suponer un desgaste 
excesivo. Esto puede provocar que las calderas no funcionen de forma eficiente sin la 
protección adecuada de la superficie contra la corrosión, la erosión e incluso las fisuras.

Servicios de calderas
Es fundamental determinar qué tipo de proceso 
perjudicial afecta al equipo. La protección mediante 
recargue con soldadura puede degradarse con el paso 
del tiempo y su longevidad depende no solo de la calidad 
de la aplicación, sino también de las condiciones en que 
funcione la caldera. Una temperatura muy localizada, 
las turbulencias, el efecto de los gases de escape y 
las cenizas pueden provocar una reducción de la vida 
de servicio del recrecimiento. Unifuse ofrece la mejor 
calidad con la menor disolución posible tanto si se utiliza 
en el proceso de reconstrucción del material base para 
el recrecimiento del espesor mínimo (garantizando la 
restauración de la pared de presión) como si se aplica 
como un recargue resistente a la corrosión, lo cual 
permite que la caldera funcione de la forma más eficiente.

Auditoría previa al trabajo 
Durante la fase de evaluación del proyecto, realizamos una visita previa para 
asegurarnos de que nuestro personal y procedimientos respondan a las 
exigencias de los clientes en materia de seguridad, salud, medio ambiente y 
control de calidad. 
Mediante diversas pruebas, determinaremos si es necesario recrecer los tubos, 
realizar una reparación concreta para restaurar la barrera de presión o si se 
puede recargar directamente la caldera.
Preparación de la superficie
Antes del recargue, nuestros inspectores de calidad de nivel II o III revisarán 
la superficie previamente chorreada (SA 3), determinarán el espesor e 
identificarán los defectos.
Las superficies deben estar libres de cualquier posible contaminación, como 
revestimientos refractarios o Inconel fatigado. En caso de que existiese un 
recargue con soldadura anterior, hay que desbastar la superficie para eliminar 
los posibles defectos (p. ej., poros). Durante esta fase se repararán todos los 
defectos visibles.
Proceso de Unifuse
Este se realiza en el modo vertical descendente desde la membrana a la 
sección de tubos, siguiendo una secuencia preprogramada del cordón de 
soldadura para lograr una cobertura uniforme y una superficie lisa. A cada 
cordón de soldadura se le superpone un cordón posterior para garantizar una 
cobertura total con un recrecimiento de 2 mm de espesor.
Si el espesor del tubo está por debajo del nivel mínimo para el recrecimiento, 
esto es, 2,2 mm en vertical y 2,5 mm en no vertical, entonces es necesario 
realizar recargue de acero al carbono antes del recargue anticorrosivo.
Inspección
Nuestros inspectores redactan un completo informe del trabajo realizado, que 
incluye los siguientes ensayos no destructivos (NDT):
 
∞Medición de espesor por ultrasonidos (UT) e inspección (VT) antes del recargue
 
∞inspección aleatoria durante la aplicación del recargue
 
∞identificación positiva del material (PMI), líquidos de penetrantes (PT), UT y VT una vez 
terminado el recargue
Recrecimiento con soldadura 
automatizado in situ
Además de nuestra fábrica, también realizamos reparaciones y mejoras in situ. Las 
condiciones operativas específicas que afectan a la caldera pueden provocar un 
envejecimiento del recargue con soldadura que conlleve un desgaste excesivo, en cuyo 
caso podemos realizar las reparaciones necesarias sobre el terreno. Podemos aplicar 
un recargue con soldadura en tubos de acero al carbono nuevos o usados, así como 
volver a aplicar el recargue con soldadura sobre un recargue antiguo (p. ej., Inconel).

Calderas de incineración de 
residuos y de biomasa
La gestión de los problemas de corrosión relacionados con las calderas que incineran 
residuos sólidos urbanos y que queman combustible de materiales orgánicos es un 
reto importante para los operadores.
Reparación de pared de agua en una instalación de producción de energía a partir de residuos
 
Calderas de incineración de residuos 
Los residuos sólidos urbanos son un combustible 
heterogéneo que contiene numerosas impurezas (p. ej., 
cloro, azufre, sodio, zinc, plomo y otros metales pesados). 
Durante la combustión del combustible, estas impurezas 
generan un entorno corrosivo que reduce la vida del 
acero al carbono. Esto a menudo acaba afectando a los 
tubos y, en consecuencia, se procede a realizar paradas 
imprevistas de la caldera. La atmósfera corrosiva afecta a 
los tubos de la caldera, las paredes de agua, los tubos de 
los sobrecalentadores, los hornos, recalentadores y los 
economizadores.
Calderas de biomasa
Las calderas de biomasa utilizan combustible obtenido 
de materiales orgánicos, como restos agrícolas, restos 
forestales o de plantas, cultivos energéticos y virutas RT 
(combustible de madera recuperada) que se pueden mezclar 
con los residuos urbanos. Estos combustibles a menudo 
contienen cantidades importantes de elementos como 
cloro, potasio, metal alcalino, sodio, azufre, plomo o zinc.
El proceso de combustión libera gases de escape que 
contienen compuestos de bajo punto de fusión, los cuales 
provocan corrosión y forman depósitos que se funden 
en la superficie del tubo sobrecalentador y limitan el 
coeficiente de transferencia de calor al vapor de los tubos.
Recargue con soldadura Unifuse con 
aleación 625
Para que una caldera funcione en estas duras condiciones 
durante numerosos años, los tubos deben tener una capa 
que los proteja de la corrosión. Unifuse® con aleación 
625 (entre otros) ha demostrado que es la solución más 
eficiente para los ataques de corrosión de los productos 
de la combustión en las calderas y de los flujos de gases 
de escape calientes en los sistemas de recuperación 
de calor residual. Asimismo, esta solución mantiene la 
integridad estructural de las paredes de agua.
Son los fabricantes de calderas quienes deben decidir 
si apuestan por maximizar los beneficios económicos 
de una vida de servicio más larga, evitar apagados 
imprevistos y ahorrar costes de mantenimiento durante la 
próxima avería.

Servicios de calderas
 
Al quemarlo, el azufre, la principal impureza 
del carbón, genera emisiones de óxidos de 
azufre (SOx) que provocan problemas como 
la corrosión a altas temperaturas. Tras la 
combustión, las cenizas del carbón pueden ser 
arrastradas en los gases de escape y provocar 
erosión por cenizas volantes en las superficies 
que absorben el calor (p. ej., los tubos de las 
paredes de agua, los lechos fluidizados, los 
recalentadores y los economizadores). Los 
problemas de escorificación provocados por 
los depósitos de cenizas en las paredes de 
los hornos pueden provocar problemas de 
incrustaciones. Los métodos de eliminación de 
cenizas (con vapor, chorros de agua o cañones 
de agua) también pueden conllevar una nueva 
corrosión/erosión y fatiga térmica.
 
Los recalentadores suelen estar hechos 
de acero al carbono o aceros de cromo-
molibdeno (p. ej., acero ferrítico: T11, T22). 
La corrosión rápida a altas temperaturas de 
estos tubos de acero se puede producir allí 
donde hay zonas de alta potencia calorífica. 
La combustión de las lejías produce una 
fusión inorgánica que es rica en carbonato 
sódico (Na2CO3) y sulfuro de sodio (Na2S). Su 
combustión genera un estrechamiento de las 
paredes de los tubos debido a la sulfuración 
del acero al carbono, otros sulfuros y sales de 
potasio también pueden depositarse en los 
tubos, colada en el suelo, la pared del labio 
de colada y las principales aperturas de aire y 
provocar una corrosión aún mayor.
Calderas de carbón
Calderas de recuperación
La industria mundial del carbón ha estado sometida a numerosos reglamentos, a 
cambios económicos y al aumento de las extracciones de gas de las formaciones de 
pizarra. Esta tendencia ha reconvertido a Europa en el principal comprador de carbón 
con alto contenido de azufre corrosivo.
La caldera de recuperación es uno de los sistemas de procesado más críticos 
de las fábricas de pasta y papel, donde el aumento de la corrosión en los tubos 
recalentadores se ve muy afectado por los factores operativos de la caldera (p. ej., la 
temperatura).

Avec plus de 30 années d’expérience dans la protection 
des chaudières, la technologie Unifuse® d’WSI répond 
à ce besoin en assurant une protection optimale des 
surfaces d’échange des chaudières d’incinération, 
biomasse, charbon, liqueur noire et les hottes dans la 
fabrication de l’acier, tels que les fours électriques à arc 
ou les convertisseurs à oxygène.
Unifuse est une solution technique rentable répondant aux 
problématiques de corrosion/d’érosion provoquées par 
les procédés de production ou par les gaz de combustion 
chauds provenant des systèmes de production d’énergie, 
notamment dans l’incinération. Unifuse prolonge la 
durée de vie opérationnelle des tubes et des panneaux 
de chaudière, ce qui permet d’éviter ou de retarder 
considérablement des remplacements coûteux.
La technologie Unifuse
Des normes et des codes stricts, tels que les codes EN et ASME, règlementent les 
exigences de résistance pour la conception et la construction de chaudières. Une 
tolérance de corrosion est intégrée dans l’épaisseur de la paroi initiale de la plupart de 
ces composants, mais les conditions de fonctionnement et l’environnement peuvent 
entraîner une usure prématurée. Quand les surfaces d’échange ne sont pas protégés 
contre la corrosion, l’érosion ou même la fissuration, les coûts de fonctionnement et 
de maintenance peuvent être lourdement affectés.

Services de chaudière
Il est crucial d’identifier le phénomène de dégradation 
qui nuit à l’équipement. La protection offerte par 
le rechargement par soudage peut s’user avec le 
temps et sa longévité dépend non seulement de la 
qualité de l’application, mais aussi des conditions de 
fonctionnement de la chaudière. Les températures très 
localisées, les turbulences, le contact avec les gaz de 
combustion et les cendres peuvent réduire la durée de vie 
du rechargement. Unifuse offre la meilleure qualité avec 
la dilution la plus faible possible, que ce soit dans le cadre 
d’un renforcement afin de reconstituer une épaisseur 
nominale (restauration de paroi) ou d’un rechargement 
résistant à la corrosion afin d’optimiser la rentabilité du 
fonctionnement de la chaudière.

Contrôle avant intervention 
Au cours de la phase d’évaluation du projet, nous effectuons une visite avant 
intervention afin de garantir que notre personnel et nos procédures sont 
conformes aux exigences clients en matière de protection de la santé, de 
sécurité, d’environnement et d’assurance qualité.
Une série de mesures nous permettra de déterminer s’il est nécessaire de 
renforcer les tubes, de procéder à une réparation spécifique pour rétablir 
la limite de résistance à la pression, ou si la chaudière peut être rechargée 
directement.
Préparation des surfaces
Avant le rechargement, nos inspecteurs de niveau II et/ou de niveau III 
examineront la surface sablée (SA 3), détermineront l’épaisseur et repéreront 
les défauts. Les surfaces doivent être libres de toute contamination éventuelle, 
notamment les revêtements réfractaires ou un ancien revêtement Inconel.
Si un rechargement par soudure a été appliqué précédemment, la surface doit 
être meulée pour éliminer tous les défauts possibles, tels que les pores. Tous  
les défauts visibles doivent être réparés lors de cette étape.
Le process Unifuse
Il est réalisé verticalement de manière descendante, de la membrane vers la 
section du tube, suivant une séquence pré-établie des cordons de soudure  
afin de garantir une couverture uniforme et une surface lisse. Le recouvrement 
entre passe est maîtrisé afin de garantir la qualité des cordons de soudure et 
assurer un revêtement régulier de 2 mm d’épaisseur.
Si l’épaisseur du tube est inférieure au niveau minimal de rechargement, soit 2,2 
mm en position verticale et 2,5 mm pour les autres positions, un renforcement 
en acier est nécessaire avant l’application du rechargement anti-corrosion.
Contrôle
Nos inspecteurs élaborent un rapport complet sur le rechargement effectué.  
Ce rapport comprend les essais non destructifs suivants
 
∞Contrôle par ultrasons et contrôle visuel avant le rechargement
 
∞Contrôles aléatoires pendant l’application du rechargement
 
∞Analyse chimique des matériaux, contrôle par ressuage, contrôle de l’épaisseur 
visuel après l’application du rechargement
Rechargement par soudage  
automatisé sur site
Outre notre atelier de fabrication, nous réalisons aussi des réparations et des 
rechargements sur site. Des conditions de fonctionnement spécifiques nuisant 
à la chaudière peuvent provoquer le vieillissement de la protection offerte par le 
rechargement par soudage et entraîner une usure prematurée. Dans ce cas, nous 
pouvons effectuer les réparations nécessaires sur site. Nous pouvons appliquer un 
rechargement par soudage sur des tubes en acier qu’ils soient neufs ou ayant déjà été 
en service. Nous pouvons également appliquer un nouveau rechargement par soudage 
sur un rechargement existant.

Chaudières d’usine d’incinération 
et chaudières à biomasse
La gestion des problèmes de corrosion associés aux chaudières destinées à 
l’incinération des déchets municipaux solides et aux chaudières utilisant un combustible 
provenant de matières organiques constitue un défi de taille pour les exploitants.
Réparation d’un mur d’eau dans une usine d’incinération
 
Chaudières d’usine d’incinération 
Les déchets municipaux solides constituent un 
combustible hétérogène qui contient de nombreuses 
impuretés, telles que du chlore, du soufre, du sodium, 
du zinc, du plomb et d’autres métaux lourds. Lors de la 
combustion, ces impuretés génèrent un environnement 
corrosif très agréssif qui réduit la durée de vie de l’acier 
au carbone. Cela peut souvent conduire une défaillance 
des tubes et par conséquent à un arrêt imprévu de la 
chaudière qui peut se révéler coûteux. L’atmosphère 
corrosive endommage les tubes des chaudières, les parois 
d’eau, les tubes des surchauffeurs, le four, et autres tubes 
d’évaporateurs et d’économiseurs.
Chaudières à biomasse
Les chaudières à biomasse utilisent un combustible 
issu de matières organiques, telles que les déchets 
agricoles, les résidus forestiers et végétaux, les cultures 
énergétiques et les copeaux RT (combustible à base de 
bois de récupération), qui peuvent être mélangées à des 
déchets municipaux. 
Ces combustibles contiennent souvent des quantités 
importantes d’éléments tels que du chlore, du potassium, 
des alcalis, du sodium, du soufre, du plomb ou du zinc. Le 
processus de combustion rejette des gaz de combustion 
contenant des composés à faible température de fusion 
qui provoquent la corrosion des surfaces et forment 
des dépôts qui fondent sur la surface des tubes des 
surchauffeurs et limitent le taux de transfert de chaleur à 
la vapeur présente dans les tubes..
Rechargement par soudage Unifuse 
avec l’alliage 625
Pour qu’une chaudière fonctionne dans ces conditions 
difficiles pendant de nombreuses années, les tubes 
nécessitent une couche de protection contre la corrosion. 
Unifuse® avec l’alliage 625 (sans s’y limiter), s’est avéré 
être la solution la plus rentable contre les problèmes de 
corrosion provoqués par les produits de combustion 
des chaudières et par les gaz chauds de combustion 
provenant de l’incinération de déchets, ainsi que pour 
maintenir l’intégrité structurelle des parois d’eau. Les 
exploitants de chaudières ont le choix de maximiser les 
retombées économiques associées à une durée de vie 
accrue, d’empêcher les arrêts imprévus et d’éviter les 
surcoûts d’entretien lors des arrêts suivants.

La combustion du soufre, principale impureté 
du charbon, provoque des émissions de 
SOx qui entraînent des problèmes tels que 
la corrosion à haute température. Après la 
combustion, les cendres du charbon peuvent 
être entraînées par les gaz de combustion et 
provoquer un phénomène d’érosion dû aux 
cendres volantes sur des surfaces d’échange de 
chaleur, notamment les tubes des murs d’eau 
des fours, les lits fluidisés, les surchauffeurs 
et les économiseurs. Les problèmes de 
scorification dus à des dépôts de cendres 
sur les parois du four peuvent provoquer des 
problèmes d’encrassement. Les méthodes 
d’élimination des cendres (avec de la vapeur, 
des lances à eau ou des canons à eau) peuvent 
également accélérer la corrosion/l’érosion et la 
fatigue thermique.
 
Les surchauffeurs sont généralement fabriqués 
en acier ou en acier Cr-Mo (par exemple 
acier ferritique : T11, T22). Ces tubes en acier 
peuvent subir une corrosion rapide à haute 
température dans les zones où la température 
est élevée. La combustion de la liqueur donne 
une masse inorganique en fusion qui est riche 
en carbonate de sodium (Na2CO3) et en sulfure 
de sodium (Na2S). Sa combustion génère un 
rétrécissement de la paroi des tubes en raison 
de la sulfuration des carbonates de l’acier au 
carbone. Des sulfures et des sels de potassium 
peuvent aussi se déposer sur les tubes, la base 
de la masse en fusion, la paroi des goulottes 
et les principales entrées d’air et entraîner 
davantage de corrosion.
Chaudières à charbon
Chaudières à récupération de 
liqueur noire
L’industrie mondiale du charbon est soumise à de nombreuses réglementations, 
aux évolutions économiques et au développement de l’extraction du gaz de schiste. 
Aujourd’hui, ces tendances positionnent à nouveau l’Europe comme le principal 
acheteur de charbon corrosif à haute teneur en soufre. 
Les chaudières à récupération de liqueur noire sont l’un des systèmes les plus critiques 
dans les usines de pâte à papier. L’augmentation de la corrosion des tubes des 
surchauffeurs est grandement affectée par les paramètres de fonctionnement de la 
chaudière, notamment la température.

Con oltre 30 anni di esperienza nel campo della 
protezione delle caldaie, la tecnologia Unifuse® di WSI 
risponde a questa esigenza fornendo una protezione di 
superficie ottimale per caldaie per termovalorizzatori, 
caldaie a biomassa, caldaie a carbone, caldaie a recupero 
di liquor nero, nonché forni e cappe nella produzione 
dell’acciaio, quali Forni Elettrici ad Arco (FEA) e Forni 
Basici a Ossigeno (FBO).
Unifuse è una soluzione tecnica conveniente contro gli 
attacchi di corrosione/erosione esercitati dai prodotti della 
combustione nelle caldaie e dal flusso dei gas di scarico 
caldi nei sistemi di recupero del calore di scarto. Unifuse 
prolunga la vita operativa dei tubi e dei pannelli delle pareti 
membranate, evitando o ritardando costose sostituzioni.
Tecnologia Unifuse
Norme e direttive rigide, come la normativa EN e ASME, regolano i requisiti di 
resistenza per la progettazione e la costruzione delle caldaie. La maggior parte di 
questi componenti ha una tolleranza alla corrosione inclusa nello spessore di parete 
iniziale, ma le condizioni operative e l’ambiente circostante possono causare un usura 
eccessiva. Ciò comporta caldaie che funzionano non economicamente e mancano 
di un’idonea protezione della superficie contro la corrosione, l’erosione e anche la 
criccatura.

Servizi di caldaie
E’ essenziale stabilire il tipo di processo che rappresenta 
un danno per l’impianto. La protezione con riporto di 
saldatura può usurarsi con il passare del tempo e la sua 
longevità dipende non solo dalla qualità dell’applicazione, 
ma anche dalle condizioni di funzionamento all’interno 
della caldaia. Temperature altamente localizzate, 
turbolenze, impatto dei gas effluenti e cenere possono 
causare un accorciamento della vita utile del rivestimento. 
La tecnologia Unifuse offre la migliore qualità con la 
minore diluizione possibile, indipendentemente dal fatto 
che venga utilizzata nel processo di build-up (riporto) per 
ottenere il recupero dello spessore minimo (garantendo il 
ripristino del muro di pressione) o che sia applicata come 
rivestimento resistente alla corrosione, consentendo 
alla caldaia di operare nel modo economicamente più 
conveniente

Verifica preliminare 
Durante la fase di valutazione del progetto, effettuiamo una visita preliminare 
per assicurarci che il nostro personale e le nostre procedure siano conformi 
ai requisiti del cliente in materia di Salute, Sicurezza e Ambiente e di 
Assicurazione della Qualità. 
Si stabilirà, con vari test, se vi è la necessità di un build-up (ristrutturazione) dei 
tubi, una riparazione specifica per ripristinare il limite di pressione, oppure se 
la caldaia può essere rivestita direttamente.
Preparazione della superficie
Prima del rivestimento, i nostri Ispettori Qualità di livello II e/o di livello III 
controlleranno la superficie sabbiata (SA 3), determineranno lo spessore e 
individueranno i difetti.
Le superfici devono essere prive di ogni possibile contaminazione, come 
refrattari, altri rivestimenti o vecchio Inconel. Se vi è un rivestimento di 
saldatura applicato in precedenza, la superficie deve essere levigata molata 
per eliminare tutti i possibili difetti, come ad esempio pori. Tutti i difetti visibili 
saranno eliminati durante questa fase.
Processo Unifuse
Si procede agendo verticalmente verso il basso dalla membrana alla sezione 
del tubo, secondo una sequenza pre-programmata di applicazione dei 
cordoni di saldatura in modo tale da ottenere una ricopertura uniforme e una 
superficie liscia. Ciascun cordone di saldatura viene coperto da un cordone di 
saldatura successivo garantendo una ricopertura totale con un rivestimento di 
2 mm di spessore.
Se lo spessore del tubo è inferiore al livello minimo di rivestimento, ovvero 2,2 
mm verticale e 2,5 mm non verticale, prima del riporto di saldatura occorre un 
build-up (ristrutturazione) in acciaio al carbonio.
Ispezione
I nostri ispettori preparano una relazione esaustiva sul rivestimento applicato 
che comprende i seguenti Controlli Non Distruttivi (CND).
 
∞Controllo ad Ultrasuoni (UT) e Controllo Visivo (VT) prima di effettuare il rivestimento
 
∞Controllo casuale durante l’applicazione del rivestimento
 
∞Identificazione Positiva del Materiale (PMI), Controllo con Liquidi Penetranti (PT), 
UT e VT dopo l’applicazione del rivestimento.
Riporto di saldatura automatica 
in campo
Oltre alla nostra produzione in officina, si effettuano anche operazioni di riparazione 
e upgrade presso il cliente. Le condizioni specifiche in cui opera la caldaia possono 
causare l’invecchiamento del rivestimento protettivo saldato a cui consegue un’usura 
eccessiva, nel qual caso possiamo effettuare sul posto le necessarie riparazioni. Si può 
applicare il rivestimento saldato su tubi nuovi o usurati in acciaio al carbonio e si può 
anche riapplicare il rivestimento saldato su un vecchio rivestimento, tipo Inconel.

Riparazione pareti membranate presso un Impianto di Recupero Energetico
 
Caldaie per Termovalorizzatori 
I rifiuti solidi urbani sono un combustibile eterogeneo 
che contiene numerose impurità come cloro, zolfo, 
sodio, zinco, piombo e altri metalli pesanti. Durante 
la combustione, queste impurità creano un ambiente 
corrosivo che riduce la vita utile dell’acciaio al carbonio. 
Il cedimento del tubo è quindi un’evenienza comune e, 
di conseguenza, si ha un costoso ed imprevisto arresto 
della caldaia. L’atmosfera corrosiva produce il suo 
effetto sui tubi delle caldaie, pareti membranate, tubi dei 
surriscaldatori, forni, banchi caldaia ed economizzatori.
Caldaie a biomassa
Le caldaie a biomassa utilizzano un combustibile derivato 
da materiali organici quali rifiuti agricoli, residui forestali 
e vegetali, colture energetiche e chip RT (combustibili da 
legnami di recupero) che possono essere miscelati con 
i rifiuti urbani. Questi combustibili contengono spesso 
quantità significative di elementi come cloro, potassio, 
alcali, sodio, zolfo, piombo o zinco.
Il processo di combustione provoca l’emissione di gas 
combusti contenenti composti organici bassofondenti  
che provocano corrosione e formano anche depositi  
che si sciolgono sulla superficie dei tubi dei surriscaldatori 
e limitano la velocità di trasferimento termico al vapore 
nei tubi.
Riporto di saldatura Unifuse con lega 625
Affinché una caldaia lavori in queste condizioni difficili 
per diversi anni, i tubi richiedono uno strato di protezione 
contro la corrosione. Unifuse® con lega 625 (e altro) ha 
dimostrato di essere la soluzione più conveniente contro 
gli attacchi della corrosione da parte dei prodotti della 
combustione nelle caldaie e dei flussi dei gas di scarico 
caldi negli impianti di recupero del calore dai rifiuti, oltre 
a mantenere l’integrità strutturale dei pannelli Waterwall 
delle pareti membranate.
I conduttori delle caldaie hanno la possibilità di 
massimizzare i vantaggi economici legati alla maggiore 
vita operativa, nonché di evitare gli arresti imprevisti e i 
costi di manutenzione durante la fermata successiva.

Se bruciato, lo zolfo, principale impurità del carbone, provoca 
l’emissione di SOx con conseguenti problemi come la corrosione 
ad alta temperatura. Dopo la combustione, la cenere prodotta dal 
carbone può essere trasportata nei gas effluenti e causare erosione 
da ceneri volanti sulle superfici che assorbono calore, come tubi 
delle pareti membranate del forno letti fluidi, surriscaldatori ed 
economizzatori. La scorificazione dovuta ai depositi di cenere  
sulle pareti del forno può causare problemi di incrostazione. I 
metodi di rimozione delle ceneri (con vapore, lance o cannoni ad 
acqua) possono anche causare un’ulteriore corrosione/erosione e 
fatica termica.
Riporto di saldatura Unifuse con lega 622
WSI è stata scelta per fornire riporto di saldatura su molte caldaie a 
carbone con Unifuse® 622. Unifuse con lega 622 vanta una storia 
di prestazioni comprovate contro la corrosione, la corrosione/ 
erosione e la fatica termica, risultando particolarmente efficace 
nella protezione contro la corrosione dei pannelli waterwall in 
condizioni di combustione a basso NOx.
 
I surriscaldatori sono tipicamente in acciaio al carbonio o in acciaio 
Cr-Mo (ad es., acciaio ferritico: T11, T22). Si può assistere a una 
corrosione rapida ad alta temperatura di questi tubi in acciaio in 
presenza di aree molto calde. La combustione del liquor nero 
produce una massa fusa inorganica ricca di carbonato di sodio 
(Na2CO3) e solfuro di sodio (Na2S). Questa combustione provoca 
l’assottigliamento delle pareti dei tubi a causa della solforazione 
dell’acciaio al carbonio. Carbonati, solfuri e sali di potassio possono 
inoltre depositarsi sui tubi, sulla superficie di scorrimento della 
massa fusa, sulla parete dell’imboccatura e sulle aperture principali 
per l’aria, causando un’ulteriore corrosione.
Riporto di saldatura Unifuse con lega 309, 
310 e GR383
I tubi protetti con Unifuse lega 309, 310 o GR383, applicando il 
processo GMAW/GTAW brevettato da WSI rappresentano una 
soluzione economicamente conveniente e a lungo termine per 
il problema della corrosione dei surriscaldatori, evitando nel 
contempo la necessità di saldature metalliche differenti.
Caldaie a carbone
Caldaie a Recupero di Liquor Nero
L’industria mondiale del carbone è stata oggetto di una serie di regolamentazioni, 
modifiche di carattere economico e aumento dell’estrazione di gas da formazioni 
di rocce sedimentarie. Questo andamento ha riproposto l’Europa quale compratore 
primario di carbone corrosivo ad alto tenore di zolfo.
La caldaia a recupero di liquor nero è uno degli impianti di processo più critici 
per la pasta di legno e le cartiere, mentre l’aumento della corrosione nei tubi dei 
surriscaldatori è notevolmente influenzato dai fattori operativi della caldaia come  
la temperatura.

A solda de revestimento horizontal resulta em baixa diluição, 
um elemento crítico para o sucesso da proteção contra 
corrosão do revestimento. Outra característica desse 
processo é uma pequena zona afetada pelo calor e distorção 
mínima.
A comparação do nosso processo horizontal com a prática 
vertical descendente, especificamente para aplicação em 
vaso de pressão, mostra que o método horizontal evita 
grandes entradas de calor – localizada – o que resulta 
em maiores gradientes de temperatura durante a fase 
de resfriamento do processo de soldagem. Por isso, é 
possível evitar o alto risco característico de protuberâncias 
localizadas no casco, devido à combinação de grande 
entrada de calor localizada e à tensão compressiva axial 
desenvolvida a partir de cargas externas (cargas estruturais) 
atuantes no vaso no momento da solda.
A solda de revestimento horizontal aplicada ao longo de 
uma área de 360° de um vaso resulta em entrada de calor 
homogênea e, portanto, menor gradiente de temperatura e 
um risco mínimo de distorção. 
O processo Unifuse permite aumentar a espessura da parede 
para restaurar o limite de pressão e aplicar uma metalurgia 
melhorada para reduzir os efeitos de erosão e corrosão, 
fornecendo uma qualidade consistente por assegurar uma 
diluição e distorção nos menores níveis possíveis. Esse 
processo também permite que os clientes controlem o seu 
cronograma ao manter o risco ocupacional o mais baixo 
possível.

Quando o cronograma é crucial 
O processo de solda vertical descendente é muito mais 
rápido do que o processo horizontal, incluindo elevada 
entrada de calor e gradiente de temperatura relacionados 
ao processo. Por isso, existe um alto risco de diluição e 
possibilidade de distorção.
No entanto, o nosso departamento técnico pode 
desenvolver cuidadosamente um processo vertical 
descendente, levando em conta diferentes fatores como 
espessura da parede, condições ambientais e quedas de 
temperatura (isolação vs. convecção natural/forçada), 
afim de evitar esse risco associado e entregar um 
cronograma dentro da mais alta qualidade possível.
Solda de revestimento vs. outras 
soluções
Existem diferentes métodos para o reparo de 
componentes mecânicos danificados. O critério de 
decisão decidirá o método escolhido.

Diese Branche sieht sich mit einer Reihe von grundsätzlichen Herausforderungen 
konfrontiert. Jedes dieser Probleme erfordert eine individuelle Lösung, die 
wir auf der Grundlage unseres in unzähligen Raffinerien in allen Regionen der 
Welt gesammelten, umfangreichen Erfahrungsschatzes erstellen, wie in der 
nachstehenden Tabelle gezeigt.
Herausforderungen 
Lösungen
Die Lebensdauer der 
Anlage verlängern und ihre 
Leistungsfähigkeit steigern
Wir lösen das Problem direkt an der Wurzel 
durch eine dauerhafte Reparaturlösung 
- mit Hilfe unserer automatisierten 
Auftragsschweiß-Technologie wird 
Materialaustausch vermieden.
Die mechanische Integrität 
der Anlage verbessern
Die Anlage mittels unserer automatisierten
Auftragschweißtechnologie verstärken, 
modernisieren oder strukturell reparieren, 
basierend auf unserem bewährten 
technischen Know-how und langjähriger 
Praxiserfahrung.
Wartungskosten senken
Endgültige, dauerhafte Reparaturen, die 
den zu erwartenden Betriebsbedingungen 
angepasst werden, können langfristig 
weniger Wartungen (punktuelle 
Reparaturen) und dadurch geringere
Standzeiten bedeuten. Wir können auf 
Serviceanfragen kurzfristig und innerhalb 
enger Zeitfenster reagieren und bieten rund 
um die Uhr Fertigungskapazitäten.

Fehlermöglichkeiten der Anlage
Anlagen werden häufig unter ungünstigen Umgebungsbedingungen betrieben, was, 
verbunden mit der Notwendigkeit die produktionsbedingten Schäden für die Umwelt 
gering zu halten, die Korrosions- und Erosionsanfälligkeit der verfahrenstechnischen 
Komponenten sowie der wichtigen Komponenten für Kessel, Trommeln und 
Behälter erhöht.
Eine ganze Reihe von 
potenziellen Fehlern 
beeinträchtigen die 
Zuverlässigkeit der Anlage 
und den sicheren Betrieb

Dank horizontalen Auftragschweißens kann eine geringe 
Aufmischung erreicht werden, die unerlässlich für einen 
leistungsstarken Korrosionsschutz des Materialauftrags ist. 
Weitere besondere Merkmale dieses Verfahrens sind 
kleinflächige Wärmeeinbringung und verzugsarme 
Ergebnisse. Vergleicht man insbesondere im Falle von 
Druckbehältern unser horizontales Verfahren mit dem 
herkömmlichen Fallnahtschweißen, zeichnet sich das 
horizontale Schweißen dadurch aus, dass es den höheren 
(und begrenzteren) Wärmeeinfluss vermeidet, der 
während der Kühlphase des Schweißvorgangs höhere 
Temperaturgradienten verursacht.
Dadurch lässt sich das hohe Risiko des häufig auftretenden, 
lokal begrenzten Ausbeulens der Behälterwand infolge einer 
Kombination aus hoher Wärmeeinbringung und axialer 
Druckspannung, die aus während des Schweißens auf 
den Behälter wirkenden externen Lasten (Bauwerkslasten) 
resultiert, vermeiden.
Ein horizontales Auftragschweißen auf dem 360-Grad-
Umlauf um einen Behälter ergibt eine homogene 
Wärmeeinbringung und daraus abgeleitet einen niedrigeren 
Temperaturgradienten, verbunden mit einem minimalen 
Verzugsrisiko.
Dank des Unifuse-Verfahrens können wir die Wandstärke 
der druckführenden Umschließung wieder auf ihren 
ursprünglichen Wert erhöhen und sind zudem in der Lage, 
durch einen Materialauftrag mit verbesserten metallurgischen 
Eigenschaften einen wirkungsvolleren Korrosions- und 
Erosionsschutz zu bewirken. So lässt sich nicht nur 
zuverlässig eine konsistente Qualität erreichen, sondern 
auch größere Aufmischung und Ausbeulung weitestgehend 
verhindern. Dieses Verfahren gewährleistet, dass Kunden ihre 
Zeitpläne besser einhalten und ihre betrieblichen Risiken so 
gering wie möglich halten können.
Das WSI Unifuse-Verfahren
WSI kann auf mehr als 30 Jahre Erfahrungen mit der Unifuse-Technologie 
zurückblicken. Die automatisierte Schweißtechnologie nach dem Unifuse-Verfahren 
wird immer dann eingesetzt, wenn strukturelle Reparaturen, Modernisierungen oder 
Verstärkungen an Anlagen durchgeführt werden sollen, um langfristig zuverlässige 
Leistung zu gewährleisten – ein Kernziel für die mechanische Integrität wesentlicher 
Raffineriekomponenten.

Projektbeurteilung 
Der erste Schritt ist immer eine detaillierte Bestandsaufnahme 
der Bedingungen und besonderen Herausforderungen beim 
Kunden vor Ort. Wir schauen uns die Standortsituation genau 
an und beurteilen sie unter Berücksichtigung der spezifischen 
Kundenwünsche in Bezug auf Sicherheit, Zeitplan und 
Qualität. Nach dieser gründlichen Bestandsaufnahme, die von 
unseren weltweit führenden Fachleuten durchgeführt wird, 
sind wir in der Lage, die für den jeweiligen Kunden perfekt 
passende und effizienteste Lösung vorzuschlagen, wobei wir 
immer eine ingenieurtechnische Beurteilung seitens unserer 
Korrosionsfachleute, Metallurgen und Schweißfachingenieure 
zugrunde legen.
Ingenieurabteilung
Unsere Ingenieurabteilung erstellt ein umfassendes Portfolio aus 
Analysen und Vorschlägen, in denen unter anderem Verzugsreduzierung, 
Spannungsbewertung, strukturelle Stabilität sowie besondere Schweißverfahren 
aufgeführt sind, um für jede Situation ein optimales Ergebnis sicherstellen zu 
können. Unsere Metallurgen, Korrosionsfachleute und Schweißfachingenieure 
sind stets auf der Suche nach der für den jeweiligen Kunden geeignetsten 
technischen Lösung. Oberste Priorität haben bei uns zu jeder Zeit die strengsten 
Anforderungen an Sicherheit, Projektzeitpläne und Qualitätsansprüche, 
unabhängig davon, ob wir eine Finite-Elemente- Analyse (FEA) zur Bestimmung 
und Minimierung von im Rahmen eines unserer Schweißverfahren auftretenden 
Verzugs durchführen oder ob wir ein neues, innovatives Verfahren unter 
Verwendung einer Modellerstellung („Mock-Up“) vorstellen.
Der Sicherheits-, Umweltschutz-  
und Gesundheitsschutzplan (HSE)
Alle unseren Tätigkeiten, von der Analyse bis zur Projektdurchführung, sind untermauert 
durch einen ausführlichen Plan, der sämtliche Aspekte zur Gesundheit und Sicherheit

Einhaltung der strengen HSE-Standards. Bei WSI erfüllen wir höchste 
Anforderungen für Chemie und Petrochemie (SCC-Zertifikat) und 
sind branchenweit bekannt und geachtet für die Einhaltung höchster 
Sicherheitsstandards. 
Unsere qualifizierten HSE-Supervisors beurteilen den Umfang der Arbeiten, 
um sicherzustellen, dass wir in unseren Planungen etwaige Risiken 
bestmöglich antizipieren und vermeiden sowie dass die Projektdurchführung 
unter Einhaltung aller anwendbaren Sicherheitsvorschriften erfolgt. 
Unser Sicherheitsplan schließt eine vollständige Risikobewertung 
ein, in der die erforderlichen Zertifikate, Planungen, Zuständigkeiten, 
Schulungsanforderungen und aufgabenspezifischen Risiken umfassend erfasst 
und analysiert werden.

Standortbegehungen im Vorfeld
Wir legen Wert darauf, einen Service zu bieten, der in Bezug auf Sicherheit, Qualität 
und den vereinbarten Zeitplan hohe Ansprüche erfüllt. Auf allen Unternehmensebenen, 
vom Standortmanager bis zum Schweißer, werden all unsere Projekte durch hoch 
qualifizierte, erfahrene und zertifizierte Mitarbeiter durchgeführt.
 
Während der Bestandsaufnahme für ein Projekt führen 
wir in der Regel eine Standortbegehung mit den 
wichtigsten Mitarbeitern für die technischen Aspekte 
und die Projektdurchführung durch. So können wir mit 
allen relevanten Beteiligten die beste und praktischste 
Lösung für den jeweiligen Standort ermitteln. Dadurch 
können wir gewährleisten, dass wir die optimale Lösung 
anbieten können, und sind in der Lage, ein genaueres Bild 
des jeweiligen Standorts zu erstellen und unsere Pläne 
hinsichtlich Durchführungsmodalitäten und Zeitfenster zu 
optimieren.

Korrosionsbeständiges Auftragschweißen
Unifuse-Auftragschweißen für Neuaufbau und Korrosionsschutz  
Unser automatisiertes Verfahren ist in der Lage, die durch den Neuaufbau der Schweißnaht 
verlorene Wandstärke auszugleichen und ist durch sein hochwertiges Auftragssystem 
auch dazu geeignet, an bestimmten, lokal begrenzten Stellen Korrosionsprobleme 
durch Modifikation mit hochwertigem Material aufzufangen. Unser wichtigstes Ziel ist 
es, dauerhafte Reparaturlösungen anzubieten, mit denen die Ursache des Problems 
angegangen wird, um so die betriebliche Lebensdauer der Anlage zu verlängern.
Auftragschweißen an Kugeln und Kuppeln
Auftragschweißen in einer Überkopfposition  
In Bezug auf die Verbesserung der mechanischen Integrität sind wir Branchenführer, 
sogar bei Reparaturprojekten, in denen überkopf gearbeitet werden muss. Insbesondere 
können wir problemlos und sicher auch an besonders unzugänglichen Orten arbeiten, 
wie z. B. Kugeln und Kuppeln. Dieses branchenweit einzigartige Fachwissen gewährleistet, 
dass wir auch an solchen schwierigen Stellen einen hochwertigen Neuaufbau 
korrosionsbeständigen Schweißmaterials bieten können.
Auftragschweißen von Stutzen
Automatisierte Vor-Ort-Reparatur von Stutzen  
Mit unserer voll automatisierten Technologie können wir Lösungen für 
Korrosionsprobleme in Stutzen anbieten, deren Durchmesser im Bereich von 5 cm (2”) 
bis 60 cm (24”) liegen. Diese Technologie sorgt für einen durchgängigen, qualitativ 
hochwertigen Materialauftrag und vermeidet dadurch hohe Austauschkosten.
Orbitalschweißen
Reparatur Wand durchdringender Risse bei Rundnähten an  
Boden-Schale-Verbindungen  
In Verbindung mit der Engspaltvorbereitung sind wir dank unserer Leistungsfähigkeit 
beim Orbitalschweißen in der Lage, hochwertige Schweißnähte an Anlagen wie Rohre, 
Rohrleitungen und Pigtails innerhalb relativ eng gesteckter Zeitpläne anzubringen. Beim 
Orbitalschweißen lassen sich sämtliche Parameter so kontrollieren, dass eine hochwertige, 
makellose Naht entsteht, insbesondere bei dickwandigen Bauteilen.
Strukturelle Verstärkung
Einschließlich “Tapering“, um weitere Spannungszustände zu vermeiden  
Wir bieten strukturelle Reparaturen von Bauteilen und die Verstärkung von Anlagen an, 
um deren Lebensdauer zu verlängern. Mit der Anbringung maßgeschneiderter, speziell 
entworfener struktureller Verstärkungen lassen sich erfolgreich Risse, Schweißnahtränder 
oder andere, aus Materialermüdung resultierende mechanische Beschädigungen 
reparieren.
Im Anschluss an unsere umfassende Analyse, die 
Standortbegehung und die Sicherheitsplanungen 
erstellen wir einen Schweißplan mit den für 
das spezielle Kundenprojekt erforderlichen, 
unterschiedlichen Schweißverfahren. Näheres 
hierzu in den folgenden Abschnitten. Durch dieses 
methodische Vorgehen können wir immer die beste 
Lösung für das konkret beim Kunden vorliegende 
Problem anbieten.
Automatisiertes  
Auftragschweißen vor Ort
Druckbehältern
Falls am jeweiligen Behälter bereits Schweißplattierungen oder 
-aufträge vorliegen, müssen diese mittels eines Fugenhobels vorab 
sorgfältig entfernt werden. Automatisiertes Auftragschweißen 
beruht auf dem Prinzip der Auftragung einer durchgängigen 
Schicht neuen Materials, das vollständig mit dem Grundmaterial 
verschmilzt. Um eine strukturelle Verstärkung zu bewirken, kann 
die Wandstärke wiederhergestellt werden (Neuaufbau) und die 
Materialeigenschaften der Anlage im Rahmen eines durchgängigen 
Korrosionsschutzes können verbessert werden.
9
Unser striktes Qualitätssicherungssystem (QS) 
fordert für sämtliche Schweißverfahren die höchsten 
Qualitätsauflagen und gewährleistet zudem, dass in  
allen Phasen des Projekts höchste Qualitätsniveaus 
erreicht werden.
Unsere QS-Inspektoren erstellen zu jedem 
abgeschlossenen Projekt einen umfassenden 
Bericht.
Unser klassischer Abschlussbericht enthält folgende 
zerstörungsfreien Prüfungen (ZfP/NDT), die vor Ort von 
unserem QM-Beauftragten durchgeführt werden:
 
∞UT, VT vor dem Auftragschweißen
 
∞Stichprobenartig während des Auftragschweißens
 
∞UT, VT, PMI und PT nach Abschluss des 
Auftragschweißens
 
∞Rundheitsabweichung vor und nach dem 
Auftragschweißen 
Alle WSI Fachkräfte sind nach EN 287-1 und EN ISO 14732 
oder ASME zertifiziert und der Umfang der Arbeiten erfolgt 
in Übereinstimmung mit den Anforderungen gemäß der 
Druckgeräterichtlinie (DGRL) 97/23/EG sowie anwendbaren 
Bemessungs- und Herstellungsnormen für Druckgeräte.
Unser Qualitätssicherungssystem ist zertifiziert nach EN 
ISO 3834- 3, AD-Merkblatt HP0 (TRB 200), TRD 201 und 
ASME U & S.
Sämtliche Schweißverfahren erfüllen die Anforderungen 
gemäß EN ISO 15614-1 und 7 und/oder EN 288 sowie TÜV-
Merkblatt 1156/1166 bzw. ASME BPVC.

Wenn Zeit der entscheidende Faktor ist
In Bezug auf die Arbeitsgeschwindigkeit ist das Fallnahtschweißen 
dem horizontalen Schweißen zwar überlegen, es kommt 
allerdings während des Schweißens zu größerer punktueller 
Wärmeeinbringung und einem höheren Temperaturgradienten, was 
ein erhöhtes Risiko von Aufmischung und eventuellem Verzug nach 
sich zieht.
Dessen ungeachtet kann unsere ingenieurtechnische Abteilung 
ein geeignetes Fallnahtschweißverfahren konzipieren, das 
unterschiedliche Aspekte wie Wandstärke, Umgebungsfaktoren 
und Kühlkörper berücksichtigt (Isolierung gegenüber natürlicher/
erzwungener Konvektion). So können bekannte Risiken vermieden 
und Zeitpläne besser eingehalten werden, bei gleichzeitiger 
Erfüllung höchstmöglicher Qualitätsansprüche. WSI bietet 
eine einzigartige, voll automatisierte Reparaturlösung für 
Stutzendurchmesser zwischen 5 cm (2”) und 60 cm (24”).
Auftragschweißen im Vergleich zu  
anderen Lösungen
Zur Reparatur von Schäden an mechanischen Bauteilen 
werden die unterschiedlichsten Verfahren angeboten. Welches 
Verfahren ausgewählt wird, ist in erster Linie von den relevanten 
Entscheidungskriterien abhängig.
Optimaler Schutz für Fermenter
Um Fermenter mit einem dauerhaften Schutz zu versehen, setzen wir seit über 
30 Jahren erfolgreich hochwertige Stahllegierungen (309, 312) ein. Dank unseres 
patentierten Unifuse-Verfahrens sind wir in der Lage, diese Stahllegierungen in unseren 
Schweißarbeiten so einzusetzen, dass Erstarrungsrissbildungen ausgeschlossen 
sind. In der Regel wenden wir dieses Verfahren horizontal an, was eine konstante 
Chromkonzentration (üblicherweise > 25 %) im gesamten Auftrag gewährleistet. 
Darüber hinaus müssen mit Fugenhobeln alte Schweißaufträge abgetragen werden.

Failure mode of the asset
Assets function in hostile operating environments and, combined with the need to 
reduce the environmental impact of production, this increases the corrosion and 
erosion of process equipment, and critical boiler, drum and vessel components.
A range of common failures 
affects the reliability of the 
asset and the safe operation 
of the plant.

Horizontal weld overlay results in a low dilution that is critical 
for the success of corrosion protection of the overlay. Other 
characteristics of this process are a small heat-affected zone  
and minimal distortion.
Comparing our horizontal process with the vertical down 
practice, specifically for pressure vessel application, the 
horizontal method avoids the higher – and localized – heat 
input that results in higher temperature gradients during the 
cooling phase of the weld process.
Therefore, it is possible to avoid the typically high risk of 
localized buckling in the shell due to the combination of a 
localized great heat input and the axial compressive stress 
developed from external loads (structural loads) acting on 
the vessel at the time of welding.
A horizontal weld overlay applied along the 360° area of a 
vessel results in a homogeneous heat input and, therefore, in 
a lower temperature gradient and minimal distortion risk. 
The Unifuse process enables us to increase wall thickness 
to restore the pressure boundary and to apply an improved 
metallurgy to reduce the effects of erosion and corrosion, 
thereby delivering consistent quality by assuring the lowest 
dilution and distortion possible. This process also allows 
customers to control their schedule by keeping occupational 
risk as low as possible.
The WSI Unifuse process
WSI has over 30 years’ experience in the protection of vessels using the Unifuse 
technology. We utilize Unifuse automated welding technology to structurally repair, 
upgrade and reinforce assets to deliver long-term, reliable performance, which is a key 
objective for the mechanical integrity of critical refinery components.

Project assessment 
The first stage of the process is to perform a complete 
assessment of the challenges faced by the customer.  
We provide a detailed evaluation of the situation,  
taking into account the customer’s desired end result for 
safety, schedule and quality. This thorough assessment, 
performed by our world-class teams, enables us to 
propose the most suitable and efficient solution for  
the customer, beginning with an engineering evaluation 
completed by our corrosion metallurgists and  
welding engineers.
Engineering
Our engineering department offers a complete range of 
analysis, including distortion mitigation, stress evaluation, 
structural stability, and special welding procedures to 
assure optimal performance at all times. Our qualified 
tooling metallurgical, corrosion and welding engineers 
strive to determine the most suitable technical solutions 
for our customers. At all times, we observe the strictest 
requirements for safety, project schedules and  
quality, whether we perform an FEA to predict and 
minimize the distortion associated with our welding 
process or demonstrate an innovative process by means 
of a mock-up.

Pre-job site inspections
We take care to deliver all services to a high level of safety, quality and in the agreed 
time. Our projects are executed using highly experienced, trained and certified 
personnel at all levels, from site managers to welders.
 
During the evaluation phase of the project, we normally 
perform a pre-job site visit with key implementation 
and technical personnel, which helps us to clarify the 
best solution from a practical viewpoint with the various 
parties involved. This enables us to confirm that the best 
solution has been offered and gives a better vision of 
the actual site situation and how to further optimize our 
execution plan and schedule.

Corrosion-resistant weld overlay
Unifuse weld overlay for both build-up and corrosion resistance  
Our automated process has the ability to recover thickness lost by weld build-
up and can also be applied to provide an appropriate material upgrade for a 
localized corrosion problem by assuring a high-quality deposit. Our primary 
focus is to provide permanent repair solutions that solve the root cause of the 
problem and extend the operational lifespan of the asset.
Weld overlay on spheres and domes
Overlay on an overhead position  
We lead the industry in the enhancement of the mechanical integrity even 
if the repair is in an overhead position. Crucially, we have the capability to 
operate safely in some of the most inaccessible areas, such as domes and 
spheres. This industry-leading expertise ensures a high-quality build-up and 
corrosion-resistant weld overlay.
Nozzle overlay
Onsite automated nozzle repair  
With our fully automated technology, we offer solutions for corrosion issues 
in nozzles from 24 inches down to 2 inches in diameter, delivering the same 
high-quality deposit, thus avoiding expensive replacement costs.
Orbital welding
Repair of through-wall cracks in head to shell circumferential welds  
Our orbital welding capabilities, combined with a narrow groove preparation, 
allows us to perform a high-quality welding joint on assets such as pipes, 
pigtails, and tube replacement in a relatively short schedule. Orbital welding 
allows us to control all parameters to achieve a high-quality, flawless joint, 
especially for thick-section components.
Structural reinforcement
Including tapering for avoiding further stress  
We offer structural repair of components and reinforce assets to extend 
the asset lifetime. Adding a tailored, designed structural reinforcement can 
successfully repair cracks, welding seams and other mechanical damage 
resulting from fatigue.
Following the results of our comprehensive analysis, 
inspections and safety planning, we then implement 
the various types of welding procedures to solve 
the customer’s specific problem, as described in the 
following sections. This methodical process results in 
our ability to provide the best solution for the customer’s 
particular asset failure.
Automated weld overlay on site
Pressure Vessel Services
In case there is existing cladding or weld overlay on the 
vessel, this needs to be carefully removed by the gouging 
process. Automated weld overlay allows for the application 
of a consistent layer of new metal, fully fused to the 
original base material. Wall thickness can be restored 
(build-up) for structural reinforcement and the unit material 
can be upgraded for consistent corrosion resistance.

Our rigorous Quality Assurance (QA) program determines 
the highest standards for all welding procedures and also 
ensures maximum quality levels are achieved throughout 
the entire project.
Our inspectors produce a comprehensive report

When schedule is crucial 
The vertical down welding process is much faster than 
the horizontal process, though there is a high heat 
input and temperature gradient related to this process; 
therefore, there is a high risk of dilution and possible 
distortion.
However, our engineering department can carefully 
design an appropriate vertical down process by taking 
into consideration different factors such as wall thickness, 
ambient conditions, and heat sinks (insulation vs. natural/
forced convection) to avoid this associated risk and 
deliver a better schedule whilst keeping the quality as 
high as possible.
Welding overlay vs. other solutions
There are many different methods used to repair 
damaged mechanical components. Above all, the 
decision criteria will define the method chosen.
Optimal protection 
for digesters
To protect digesters, alloys such as 309 and 312 steel have been successfully used for 
more than 30 years. Our Unifuse® patented process for applying 309 and 312 alloys 
allows us to achieve a weld overlay free of solidification cracks. This process is typically 
applied horizontally, thereby assuring a constant Cr concentration (typically >25%) 
across the overlay. In addition, the old cladding must be removed by means of gouging.

118 Series 
Glass has a memory—it holds onto shapes 
it was exposed to while still molten. 118’s 
dozens of tiny feather-like forms, in either 
opal or coloured glass, arise from this 
uncanny ability. When lit from within, the 
interior complexities of 118 come into even 
sharper detail.

14 Series 
Glass is poured into a hemispherical mold. 
As the glass cools, a meniscus shape forms 
on the open face of the piece. Two of these 
pieces are joined to form an articulated 
sphere, with the two voids in the middle 
yielding a certain optical quality. A cylindrical 
void passes through both hemispheres and 
houses a light source.

Formed by sequentially pouring three 
separate puddles of molten glass of varying 
opacity and colour over a horizontal plane. 
Each layer responds to the indeterminate 
shape of the previous pour to create a 
layered whole. Two of these pieces are then 
attached to house an internal light source.

28 Series 
An innovative fabrication process that 
manipulates both the temperature and the 
direction of air flow into blown glass. The 
result is a slightly distorted sphere with 
an interior landscape of satellite shapes, 
including an opaque milk glass diffuser that 
houses either a low-voltage xenon or LED 
lamp.

P-649,https://www.emergencylighting.com/productpdfs/0603436_pgn_spec.pdf,Yes,"Application
The PGN is an indoor or outdoor architectural high performance 
LED sconce which offers ""Normally On"" and emergency operation 
in one fixture.  ""Normally On"" operation is powered by line voltage 
(120 or 277) that can be switched on/off and used for accent 
lighting, entrance/exit illumination.  Failure of line voltage will result 
in automatic operation from secondary DC voltage which must be 
supplied from an external 6-12V DC emergency lighting unit.  The 
PGN includes a field installable full cut-off shield to address ""dark 
sky"" compliant requirements.
Construction
Housing and mounting plate are constructed of 1/8"" die-cast 
aluminum and sealed with a 1/8"" closed-cell silicone gasket. The 
acrylic lens allows 92% light transmission.  The reflector is electro-
polished aluminum with 95% reflectance.  Housing finish is powder 
coated electro-deposition paint available in four colors: dark bronze, 
white, platinum silver and black.  Full cut-off shield constructed of 
cold-rolled steel, painted to match color as ordered.
Installation
Universal backplate knockouts for mounting to standard 31/2"", 4"" 
octagonal and 4"" square electrical boxes. Backplate mounting is 
performed using installer supplied hardware.  An adhesive-backed 
neoprene gasket is provided to ensure a waterproof seal.  
A 1/2"" – 1/4 NPT threaded conduit opening is provided at the top of 
the enclosure and sealed with a closure plug.  The housing “snaps” 
to the back plate by a “pin and socket” arrangement, and is secured 
with two Phillips head screws. 
Illumination
The unit is illuminated by 4 high power LED's arranged so that in the 
event of 1 or 2 LED failures the unit will continue to operate.

Electronics
The PGN has two modes of operation:
Normal mode:  In normal mode, power is suppled from 120V or 
277V AC source and may be switched on/off allowing the unit to 
behave like a typical luminaire.
Emergency mode:  Upon failure of normal utility power, an external 
(6-12VDC) emergency power source (supplied separately) having 
transfer logic will operate the PGN as an emergency unit.  In 
order for the unit to function properly as emergency lighting 
(NEC 700.12), the DC emergency source must be powered (under 
normal conditions) from the same AC circuit as that to the unit.
Number of Lamps:  Four High Output LEDs
LED Lamplife:  48,000 hrs. at 70% of initial
Lamp Configuration:  4 individually driven LEDs provide 
illumination.  In the event  of 1 or 2 LED failures, the remaining 
LED's will continue to function.

Smoke alarms save lives. If there is a fire in your home, smoke spreads fast and 
you need smoke alarms to give you time to get out. Having a working smoke 
alarm cuts the chances of dying in a reported fire in half. Almost two-thirds of home fire deaths resulted from 
fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms.
1) Install smoke alarms inside and outside each bedroom and sleeping area. Install alarms on every level of the 
home. Install alarms in the basement. 
2) It is best to use interconnected smoke alarms. When one smoke alarm sounds they all sound.
3) Test all smoke alarms at least once a month. Press the test button to be sure the alarm is working.
4) Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old.

BILIA MINI
Gio Ponti, 1932
Nothing more than a sphere, set in an apparently impossible feat
of balance, upon a cone that serves as the base. One of Gio Ponti’s
many  compositional  magic  tricks,  designed  in  1932.  The
counterbalancing of two elementary geometric forms results in an
original,  perfectly  proportioned  object.  An  unpretentious
composition,  enriched  by  the  extraordinary  balance  of  its
proportions  and  the  stylish  discretion  of  non-reflective
materials.The light is diffused and valorized by the geometrical
simplicity of the design. In designing Bilia, Gio Ponti imagined a
smaller  version  in  a  range  of  “spray  colours”.  From  those
handwritten notes of the original project, FontanaArte presents
Bilia Mini in new breathtaking chromatic variations.
Table lamp with diffused light not dimmable. Painted metal frame. Diffuser made of white blown glass with satin-finish.

TROPICO PICCOLA
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create  surprising  and  fascinating  effects,  patterns  and  moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed  by  a  large  mirrored  metal  boss.  The  family  comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes.

TROPICO MEDIUM
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create  surprising  and  fascinating  effects,  patterns  and  moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed  by  a  large  mirrored  metal  boss.  The  family  comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes.
Dimmable diffused-light table lamp. Frame in white Carrara marble. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Gold button for
the Carrara white model. Black power cable, dimmer and plug. Power supply with interchangeable plug (uk - usa - europe -
australia). Integrated LED.

The Optional WSPADAPTOR2 offset adaptor can be used to improve the field of view for fixture mounted sensors where the geometry of the fixture might 
otherwise interfere with the sensor’s performance. The adapter snaps into a standard 1/2” (12.7mm) knockout on the end of the fixture and provides several 
mounting position choices for the sensor.

The Optional WSPADAPTOR2 offset adaptor can be used to improve the field of view for fixture mounted sensors where the geometry of the fixture might 
otherwise interfere with the sensor’s performance. The adapter snaps into a standard 1/2” (12.7mm) knockout on the end of the fixture and provides several 
mounting position choices for the sensor.
Pink wire replaces previous gray wire. Units with 
a gray instead of pink wire should be wired as

The nVent LENTON brand of cryogenic reinforcement splicing
systems should be specified whenever cryogenic-grade
reinforcing bar is used, or during normal operating or
emergency conditions where the temperature falls below -20
°C (-4 °F). By combining the nVent LENTON taper-threaded
couplers with state-of-the-art materials, we have developed
one of the slimmest couplers on the market, while still
maintaining top performance. Typical construction projects
include LNG and LPG storage tanks.
FEATURES
Designed to splice the same diameter bars where the second bar can be rotated and is not restricted in its axial direction
Slim design maintains concrete cover
Installs quickly and easily
Improved performance and reliability at cryogenic temperatures (-168 °C / -270 °F)

Planning for installation
Finished wall should extend 11"" above ceiling. Locate bottom of Fixture Support Rail 9 9/32"" up from bottom of ceiling for Lay-in Grid T-bar ceilings.  
Extruded trim of fixtures supports ceiling tiles at perimeter; elsewhere ceiling construction must be supported independently of the lighting system.
Fixtures must be installed prior to hanging ceiling.
1.	 Install Fixture Support Rails on wall.
2.	 Hook fixtures on rail and slide into 
position. Attach hanger wires.
3.	 Install extensions and corners.

CONSTRUCTION
•	 Housing constructed from die-formed and 
welded steel with wiring knockouts in top 
•	 End caps constructed from die-formed steel. 
Installs from below via magnetic interface
•	 End caps overlap diffuser at each fixture  
end to eliminate gaps and LED visibility
OPTICAL PERFORMANCE
•	 2 SDCM color consistency, 90 CRI
•	 SOF: Soft diffuse acrylic lens
•	 NRW: Highly transmissive diffuse acrylic lens 
with linear prisms
•	 BWO: White blade baffle with softglo lens 
overlay. Output multiplier (.70)
INSTALLATION
•	 Finish of wall should extend 7"" above ceiling. 
Continuous Fixture Support Rail is provided 
for ease of installation. Ceiling construction 
must be supported independently of the 
lighting. Installations with straight extensions 
must be specified with wall-to-wall lengths. 
For optimal spacing from the wall, the 
amount of light provided will be rounded 
down to the nearest foot, unless this results 
in the fixture being < 2"" away from the wall 
•	 Ex. A 20'-4"" through 21'-3"" wall-to-wall length 
will result in 20' of light. A wall-to-wall length 
of 20'-3"" will produce 19' of light.  
For recommended wall uniformity, fixture 
should be between 2–4"" from wall.  
For more precise lighting, 3"" increment 
fixtures are available.
•	 LG/NG/SS Mounting: Plenum shield to rest 
on t-bar
•	 DW Mounting: Trimless appearance with fixture 
resting on back of drywall. For non-SE rows, 
drywall must be ""finished"" to close off fixture

EMI FILTERS 
An appropriately rated MRI EMI filter (supplied by others) is REQUIRED to be used on each driver/luminaire circuit to prevent interference and 
degradation of the MRI image. The EMI Filters should be rated for the DC voltage and current output of each of the driver/luminaire circuits. Use the MRI 
Trim Electrical Data table for determining the MRI EMI filter ratings needed.
Some suggested MRI EMI Lighting Filters are:
TE Corcom 1-1609091-3, 1-1609091-4, and 1-1609091-5
Astrodyne TDI 059 Series MRI EMI Filters

DMX Overview
DMX is a technology that was 
created by the entertainment 
industry back in the 90’s to help 
link theatrical lighting control 
equipment such as dimmers, 
control gear and automated 
lighting. DMX has been slowly 
ﬁnding its way into the general 
lighting market since multi-LED 
architectural lighting ﬁxtures 
have become more mainstream 
which brings the need for DMX 
into non-entertainment lighting
equipment for controlling 
sophisticated lighting projects. The DMX is best understood by talking explaining how it works and 
how it is wired.
How it Works 
A single DMX wire can communicate 512 DMX values, often called channels. Each channel has an 
ID of 1-512 and each ID can communicate a value of 0%-100% as an 8-bit number (a range of 0-255 
which correlated to 0%-100%). DMX controlled lighting ﬁxtures and other DMX devices have their 
ID (or Start address) set so they know which channel of data to monitor for adjusting its intensity or 
color. Simple white ﬁxtures might use just one address for intensity while a RGBW device requires 
four addresses so each color can be given a speciﬁc intensity. Each DMX wire of 512 control channels 
is referred to as a DMX Universe. If a project has the need to control more than 512 channels, two or 
more universes of control and separate wiring will be required.
The DMX Protocol uses a streaming serial RS485 data structure that is very robust for long wiring 
runs, with all 512 data points updating at about 33 times a second. Serial data of this nature, in 
order to be robust, must utilize the correct wire type and be wired from a DMX controller to DMX 
devices in a very speciﬁc topology.
Wiring
DMX data is conveyed down a wire utilizing 3 conductors. DMX+ (positive), DMX- (DMX negative) 
and Shield/Ground. Specialize Belden wire as well as approved Category wire can be used for 
DMX. Proper DMX wire can be run to nearly 1500 feet in ideal circumstances, but best practices 
aim for under 1000 feet. DMX devices are not all homeruns back to a control system but part of a 
Daisy-Chain. Because each device has a DMX start address, a single wire can be daisy-chain to 
many devices because each device will only listen to the channels it is set for. DMX must be wired 
in a strict Daisy-Chain and can only be Daisy-Chained thought a maximum of 32 devices or what

the device manufacturer approves. More than 32 devices in a project will require a DMX splitter 
to properly split and repeat the DMX signal to additional groups of devices. At the last device in 
a Daisy chain, on every wiring run, a DMX Terminating resistor must be added unless the device 
auto-terminates. For example, for a 60 unit continuous run, daisy-chain 1 - 30 and use terminating 
resistor on 30. Daisy-chain ﬁxture 31 - 60 and terminated by resistors at 60.
DMX is typically a one direction protocol where a DMX controller broadcasts the changes down 
the DMX wire for consumption by the devices on the Daisy-Chain. However, a new part of the DMX 
protocol, called Remote Device Management (RDM), bring new bi-directional feature to a DMX/
RDM compatible system. RDM can allow for a DMX controller to discover DMX devices, identify 
them and set their DMX start address remotely. Other RDM discoverable data point and controls 
are available but these are very speciﬁc to what a certain DMX device can support. 
Current DMX Wiring
Current RGBW ﬁxtures follow the addressing below for DMX wiring: 
Max. Fixtures on a DMX Universe:
128 ﬁxtures utilizing 4 DMX Channels
85 ﬁxtures utilizing 6 DMX Channels
1  DMX Channel 5 and 6 are only for Kim Lighting’s In-grade LTV8RGBW ﬁxtures with Pan & Tilt features.
2  Current ﬁxtures are RDM compatible.
NOTE: DMX and Power cables must NOT run in the same conduit. Fixture cabling from control box to ﬁxture shall be installed per NEC and Local Codes.

Zoning with DMX
Because DMX Devices are digitally controlled and have unique DMX Addresses, there is no need 
to wire a zone of lights with its own dedicated DMX wire. DMX devices, regardless of where they 
exist on a project, can be grouped and zones together digitally by the DMX controller. Simply  
daisy-chain all the DMX devices on one wiring run, limit of 32 + terminator, and assign them all 
unique, non-overlapping DMX ranges for control. Inside the DMX controller software lighting can be 
arranged in 1 or more groups for unique control and global commands.
DMX Troubleshooting
DMX Wire Termination – All DMX wire runs, require the end of the wire at the last fixture to be 
terminated, normally with a 121 Ohm resistor across the DMX+ and DMX- wires. There are DMX  
terminator boxes that have a resistor inside, with two screw terminals to make the installation  
simpler. A maximum of 32 devices can be on a daisy chain without repeating/boosting hardware.
A non-terminated DMX bus can exhibit jittering control, non-control, flickering or delayed response 
to control.
Wire length – Wire length normally can be as long as 500 – 1500-meter-long. Always use a DMX 
rated cable to make the connections. Be sure to keep all connections well made, solder them if 
possible. Water can deteriorate wire performance, even if it is in the insulation. Terminate the wires 
if there are issues. DMX splices should be avoided. Wire Nuts should be avoided.
Wire type – The wire type should be Belden 9841, 9729 or Category 5e, 6 only. Wire size does not matter.
Maximum Fixtures per DMX Universe – A maximum of 32 DMX fixtures per DMX daisy-chain or if 
using DMX splitters, a Maximum of 512 channels of uniquely addressed fixtures. For every 32 DMX 
fixtures, make sure to use a DMX Splitter (RDM) to maintain integrity of DMX data. 
Reversing DMX+ and DMX- wires – The wires might get reversed during installation at any segment 
of the wiring run. A reversed wire connection may seem to work but not all colors and control will be 
definite, sporadic control or inverted control may occur. Take a logical approach to check that each 
wiring connection point has the correct polarity.

NOTE	 Factory supplied template must be used when setting anchor bolts. Current Lighting will deny any claim for incorrect anchorage placement resulting from failure to use factory supplied template and anchor bolts.
Due to our continued efforts to improve our products, product specifications are subject to change without notice.
Follow the logic below when ordering location specific options. For 
each option, include its orientation (in degrees) and its height (in 
feet). Example: Option C07 should be ordered as: RSA-K-20-40-A-TA-
DBS-CO5-0-15 
(.5” coupling on the handhole/arm side of pole, 15 feet up from the 
pole base) 1’ spacing required between option. Consult factory for 
other configurations.

•	 Florida region wind map above 
is based upon 3-second gust 
winds and the 2017 Florida 
Building Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings. 
• 
Pole Strength Limited Warranty: Standard, unmodified Kim 
lighting Poles installed as recommended, undamaged by 
corrosion, or lack of maintenance, shall withstand steady 
wind conditions as provided on page 2 (Allowable Pole 
EPA). Installation of poles without luminaires, or attachment 
of any unauthorized accessories to poles shall void this 
warranty.

NOTES
• 	 Allowable EPA, to determine max pole loading weight, multiply allowable EPA by 30 lbs.
• 	 The tables for allowable pole EPA are based on the ASCE 7-05 Wind Map or the Florida Region Wind Map for the 2010 Florida Building Code. The Wind Maps are intended only as a general guide and 	
	
	
cannot be used in conjunction with other maps. Always consult local authorities to determine maximum wind velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each specific application
•	 Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be equal to or greater than the total EPA for fixtures, arms, and accessories to be assembled to the pole. Responsibility lies with the specifier for 	
	
	
correct pole selection. Installation of poles without luminaires or attachment of any unauthorized accessories to poles is discouraged and shall void the manufacturer’s warranty
• 	 Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and coefficient of height factors beyond this 	
	
	
general guide; Consult local and federal standards
• 	 Wind Induced Vibration brought on by steady, unidirectional winds and other unpredictable aerodynamic forces are not included in wind velocity ratings. Consult Hubbell Lighting’s Pole Vibration 	
	
	
Application Guide for environmental risk factors and design considerations. 
• 	 Extreme Wind Events like, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or Tornadoes may expose poles to flying debris, wind shear or other detrimental effects not included in wind velocity ratings

 FLORIDA REGION WIND 
NOTES
• 	 Allowable EPA, to determine max pole loading weight, multiply allowable EPA by 30 lbs.
• 	 The tables for allowable pole EPA are based on the ASCE 7-05 Wind Map or the Florida Region Wind Map for the 2010 Florida Building Code. The Wind Maps are intended only as a general guide and 	
	
	
cannot be used in conjunction with other maps. Always consult local authorities to determine maximum wind velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each specific application
•	 Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be equal to or greater than the total EPA for fixtures, arms, and accessories to be assembled to the pole. Responsibility lies with the specifier for 	 	
	
correct pole selection. Installation of poles without luminaires or attachment of any unauthorized accessories to poles is discouraged and shall void the manufacturer’s warranty
• 	 Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and coefficient of height factors beyond this 	 	
	
general guide; Consult local and federal standards
• 	 Wind Induced Vibration brought on by steady, unidirectional winds and other unpredictable aerodynamic forces are not included in wind velocity ratings. Consult Current Lighting’s Pole Vibration 	
	
	
Application Guide for environmental risk factors and design considerations. 
• 	 Extreme Wind Events like, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or Tornadoes may expose poles to flying debris, wind shear or other detrimental effects not included in wind velocity ratings
Due to our continued efforts to improve our products, product specifications are subject to change without notice.

•	 Florida region wind map 
above is based upon 
3-second gust winds and 
the 2017 Florida Building 
Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings. 
• 
Pole Strength Limited Warranty: Standard, unmodified Kim 
lighting Poles installed as recommended, undamaged by 
corrosion, or lack of maintenance, shall withstand steady 
wind conditions as provided on page 2 (Allowable Pole 
EPA). Installation of poles without luminaires, or attachment 
of any unauthorized accessories to poles shall void this 
warranty.

ASCE7-05      WIND MAP	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
 FLORIDA REGION WIND MAP
NOTES
• 	 Allowable EPA, to determine max pole loading weight, multiply allowable EPA by 30 lbs.
• 	 The tables for allowable pole EPA are based on the ASCE 7-05 Wind Map or the Florida Region Wind Map for the 2017 Florida Building Code. The Wind Maps are intended only as a general guide and 	
	
	
cannot be used in conjunction with other maps. Always consult local authorities to determine maximum wind velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each specific application
•	 Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be equal to or greater than the total EPA for fixtures, arms, and accessories to be assembled to the pole. Responsibility lies with the specifier for 	 	
	
correct pole selection. Installation of poles without luminaires or attachment of any unauthorized accessories to poles is discouraged and shall void the manufacturer’s warranty
• 	 Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and coefficient of height factors beyond this 	 	
	
general guide; Consult local and federal standards
• 	 Wind Induced Vibration brought on by steady, unidirectional winds and other unpredictable aerodynamic forces are not included in wind velocity ratings. Consult Current Lighting’s Pole Vibration 	
	
	
Application Guide for environmental risk factors and design considerations. 
• 	 Extreme Wind Events like, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or Tornadoes may expose poles to flying debris, wind shear or other detrimental effects not included in wind velocity ratings
Due to our continued efforts to improve our products, product specifications are subject to change without notice.

•	 Florida region wind map 
above is based upon 
3-second gust winds and 
the 2017 Florida Building 
Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings. 
• 
Pole Strength Limited Warranty: Standard, unmodified Kim 
lighting Poles installed as recommended, undamaged by 
corrosion, or lack of maintenance, shall withstand steady 
wind conditions as provided on page 2 (Allowable Pole 
EPA). Installation of poles without luminaires, or attachment 
of any unauthorized accessories to poles shall void this 
warranty.

ASCE7-05      WIND MAP	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
 FLORIDA REGION WIND 
NOTES
• 	 Allowable EPA, to determine max pole loading weight, multiply allowable EPA by 30 lbs.
• 	 The tables for allowable pole EPA are based on the ASCE 7-05 Wind Map or the Florida Region Wind Map for the 2017 Florida Building Code. The Wind Maps are intended only as a general guide and 	
	
	
cannot be used in conjunction with other maps. Always consult local authorities to determine maximum wind velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each specific application
•	 Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be equal to or greater than the total EPA for fixtures, arms, and accessories to be assembled to the pole. Responsibility lies with the specifier for 	 	
	
correct pole selection. Installation of poles without luminaires or attachment of any unauthorized accessories to poles is discouraged and shall void the manufacturer’s warranty
• 	 Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and coefficient of height factors beyond this 	 	
	
general guide; Consult local and federal standards
• 	 Wind Induced Vibration brought on by steady, unidirectional winds and other unpredictable aerodynamic forces are not included in wind velocity ratings. Consult Current Lighting’s Pole Vibration 	
	
	
Application Guide for environmental risk factors and design considerations. 
• 	 Extreme Wind Events like, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or Tornadoes may expose poles to flying debris, wind shear or other detrimental effects not included in wind velocity ratings
Due to our continued efforts to improve our products, product specifications are subject to change without notice.

•	 Florida region wind map 
above is based upon 
3-second gust winds and 
the 2017 Florida Building 
Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings. 
• 
Pole Strength Limited Warranty: Standard, unmodified Kim 
lighting Poles installed as recommended, undamaged by 
corrosion, or lack of maintenance, shall withstand steady 
wind conditions as provided on page 2 (Allowable Pole 
EPA). Installation of poles without luminaires, or attachment 
of any unauthorized accessories to poles shall void this 
warranty.

•	 Florida region wind map 
above is based upon 3-second 
gust winds and the 2017 
Florida Building Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings.

• 	 Allowable EPA, to determine max pole loading weight, multiply allowable EPA by 30 lbs.
• 	 The tables for allowable pole EPA are based on the ASCE 7-05 Wind Map or the Florida Region Wind Map for the 2010 Florida Building Code. The Wind Maps are intended only as a general guide 
and cannot be used in conjunction with other maps. Always consult local authorities to determine maximum wind velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each specific application
•	 Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be equal to or greater than the total EPA for fixtures, arms, and accessories to be assembled to the pole. Responsibility lies with the specifier 
for correct pole selection. Installation of poles without luminaires or attachment of any unauthorized accessories to poles is discouraged and shall void the manufacturer’s warranty
• 	 Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and coefficient of height factors beyond this 	
general guide; Consult local and federal standards
• 	 Wind Induced Vibration brought on by steady, unidirectional winds and other unpredictable aerodynamic forces are not included in wind velocity ratings. Consult Hubbell Lighting’s Pole Vibration 	
Application Guide for environmental risk factors and design considerations. 
• 	 Extreme Wind Events like, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or Tornadoes may expose poles to flying debris, wind shear or other detrimental effects not included in wind velocity ratings

•	 Florida region wind map above is 
based upon 3-second gust winds 
and the 2017 Florida Building Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings. 
• 
Pole Strength Limited Warranty: Standard, unmodified Kim 
lighting Poles installed as recommended, undamaged by 
corrosion, or lack of maintenance, shall withstand steady 
wind conditions as provided on page 2 (Allowable Pole 
EPA). Installation of poles without luminaires, or attachment 
of any unauthorized accessories to poles shall void this 
warranty.

NOTES
• 	 Allowable EPA, to determine max pole loading weight, multiply allowable EPA by 30 lbs.
• 	 The tables for allowable pole EPA are based on the ASCE 7-05 Wind Map or the Florida Region Wind Map for the 2010 Florida Building Code. The Wind Maps are intended only as a general guide and 	
	
	
cannot be used in conjunction with other maps. Always consult local authorities to determine maximum wind velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each specific application
•	 Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be equal to or greater than the total EPA for fixtures, arms, and accessories to be assembled to the pole. Responsibility lies with the specifier for 	 	
	
correct pole selection. Installation of poles without luminaires or attachment of any unauthorized accessories to poles is discouraged and shall void the manufacturer’s warranty
• 	 Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and coefficient of height factors beyond this 	 	
	
general guide; Consult local and federal standards
• 	 Wind Induced Vibration brought on by steady, unidirectional winds and other unpredictable aerodynamic forces are not included in wind velocity ratings. Consult Current Lighting’s Pole Vibration 	
	
	
Application Guide for environmental risk factors and design considerations.
• 	 Extreme Wind Events like, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or Tornadoes may expose poles to flying debris, wind shear or other detrimental effects not included in wind velocity ratings

•	 Florida region wind map 
above is based upon 
3-second gust winds and 
the 2017 Florida Building 
Code
HAWAII – 105 mph 
PUERTO RICO – 145 mph
NOTES:
• 
Values are based on 50 year mean recurrence interval 30’ 
above grade.
• 
Hawaii has an 105 mph wind velocity.
• 
Puerto Rico has a 125 mph wind velocity.
• 
Caution must be exercised in determining wind velocities 
in special wind areas such as:
Mountainous Regions
Areas surrounding the Great Lakes or other large bodies 
of water or open land.
Areas subject to extreme wind conditions, such as 
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes.
Areas adjacent to airports.
Any specific area with a known or suspected abnormally 
high intermittent wind condition caused by geography, 
adjacent structures, or other specific local conditions 
that may not be recorded in National Weather Service 
records.
• 
Allowable pole EPA for jobsite wind conditions must be 
equal to or greater than fixture EPA. Responsibility lies with 
the specifier for correct pole selection based on AASHTO 
wind map and job location.
• 
The Wind Map is intended only as a general guide. Always 
consult local authorities to determine maximum wind 
velocities, gusting and unique wind conditions for each 
specific application.
• 
CAUTION: Wind speeds and listed EPAs are for ground 
mounted installations. Poles mounted on structures (such 
as bridges and buildings) must consider vibration and 
coefficient of height factors beyond this general guide. 
Consult AASHTO standards.
• 
Extreme Wind Events: Hurricanes, Typhoons, Cyclones, or 
Tornadoes expose poles to flying debris, wind shear, and 
other unpredictable aerodynamic forces not indicated by 
the wind velocity ratings. 
• 
Pole Strength Limited Warranty: Standard, unmodified Kim 
lighting Poles installed as recommended, undamaged by 
corrosion, or lack of maintenance, shall withstand steady 
wind conditions as provided on page 2 (Allowable Pole 
EPA). Installation of poles without luminaires, or attachment 
of any unauthorized accessories to poles shall void this 
warranty.

The greatest benefit of installing a low voltage lighting system is the ability to conceal 
the flexible electrical cable directly under as little as 6"" of soil cover, without the need 
for conduits or raceways.
Voltage drop for KLV600 series transformers is a function of cable size, circuit 
length and connected fixture wattage. In order to attain good lumen output, it is 
recommended that each fixture be provided a minimum of 10 volts. Use the chart 
below to estimate the cable size required and maximum circuit distance allowable 
to maintain 10 volts to the farthest connected fixture on a cable run.
Copper stranded landscape cable, black, UL recognized.

NOTE: See pages 3 - 4 for Variable 
Voltage Transformers which provide 

a 12 volt tap for fixtures near the 
transformer, and higher voltages for 
more remote fixtures.

Connectors may be buried, installed at grade, or surface mounted. They are 

de­
signed to eliminate the common problem of corrosion and oxidation of the 
connections, which can cause power interruption. Injec­
tion molded in black Valox®
, 
the two-piece con­
nec­
tors have stainless steel screws.
The standard sealed connector, KLV410, is for connecting one fixture to the cable. 
The standard connector employs piercing screws, and the branch connector utilizes 
compression type connectors and brass bussbars.
All connections are totally sealed and waterproofed with the dielectric mastic 
provided. Maximum design flexibility is assured since fixtures can be easily added or 
relocated by installing a new sealed connector.

overridden so that full emergency power 
can be provided to the designated fixtures, 
regardless of switch position
•	 The BCCR20 is compatible with all lamp 
types, although HID type lamps are not 
recommended as the time to achieve full 
illumination may not be acceptable to NFPA

ELECTRONICS 
Upon failure of the normal utility power, an LED driver is automatically 
activated to power the emergency LED lamp-heads and EXIT LED’s. Upon 
resumption of normal utility power, the LED driver is turned off, and the battery 
is recharged through a micro-controller based 3-stage charger. The battery is 
a maintenance-free Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO) type. The DYNC series 
accepts dual-voltage input of 120 or 277VAC at 50 or 60 Hz. A low voltage 
battery disconnect(LVD) feature protects the battery from severe damage during 
prolonged power failures. Manual testing is available at any time using the  
push-to-test button. The optional heater features a heating wrap and thermostat  
to maintain optimal battery temperature during charge or discharge.

DETECTION COVERAGE
This figure indicates the maximum distance at the highest mounting height with 100% sensitivity.
LUX ON/OFF
Adopted dual PD technology, PRC Motion Sensor is able to differentiate artificial 
light brightness from natural light after installed inside the fixture, and automatically 
turn off light when ambient brightness exceeds preset lux level.
Preconditions to use the Lux-off function:
1.	Stand-by time is + ∞
2.	Stand-by dimming level is on 10%, 20%, 30%, or 50%
3.	Daylight threshold is on 10Lux, 30Lux, 50Lux, or 100Lux (About 20% error 
between actual and reference values).

FSP-Lx Lens Modules for FSP-2xx Series PIR Occupancy Sensors
Lens Coverage Guide
No: 24226 – 08/16  rev. 1
Catalog Number: FSP-L2/FSP-L3/FSP-L7
Country of Origin: Made in China
SPECIFICATIONS
Operating Temperature- .................... 40° to 167°F (-40° to 75°C
IP Rating when mounted to outdoor rated fixture 
................IP-66
DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION
The FSP-2xx occupancy sensor is modular, consisting of two parts, a Sensor Module  and a Lens. The Sensor Module is selected 
according to the type of power available in the installation, and the desired operational features. The Lens is selected based on the 
coverage desired for the sensor application.
Lens modules are IP-66 rated when combined with an FSP-2xx sensor mounted to an outdoor rated fixture.
Sensors must directly “see” motion of an occupant to detect them, so careful consideration must be given to sensor placement. Avoid 
placing the sensor where shelving or other obstructions may block the sensor’s line of sight.
The FSP-L2, FSP-L3, and FSP-L7 have multi-cell, multi-tier Fresnel lenses with a 360° view. This document describes the coverage 
patterns available with each lens. Coverages shown in the diagrams are maximum, measured in linear feet. They represent coverage 
for full-step walking motion, with no barriers or obstacles.
Passive Infrared Sensing in Warehouses
Warehouses can have ambient temperature variations that may affect sensor detection and coverage areas. High temperatures at the 
covered area (above 89-92°F) reduce the detection zone of the sensor. Consider adding more sensors if the ambient temperatures 
are expected to be high. Additionally, high floor level temperature may require larger movement for detection. In some cases, sensors 
mounted above 40’ may only detect large heat signatures such as forklift trucks.
See the Sensor Module Installation Instructions for a complete description of the assembled unit installation, wiring, and 
safety information.

FSP-Lx Lens Modules for FSP-2xx Series PIR Occupancy Sensors
Lens Coverage Guide
No: 24226 – 08/16  rev. 1
Catalog Number: FSP-L2/FSP-L3/FSP-L7
Country of Origin: Made in China
SPECIFICATIONS
Operating Temperature- .................... 40° to 167°F (-40° to 75°C
IP Rating when mounted to outdoor rated fixture 
................IP-66
DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION
The FSP-2xx occupancy sensor is modular, consisting of two parts, a Sensor Module  and a Lens. The Sensor Module is selected 
according to the type of power available in the installation, and the desired operational features. The Lens is selected based on the 
coverage desired for the sensor application.
Lens modules are IP-66 rated when combined with an FSP-2xx sensor mounted to an outdoor rated fixture.
Sensors must directly “see” motion of an occupant to detect them, so careful consideration must be given to sensor placement. Avoid 
placing the sensor where shelving or other obstructions may block the sensor’s line of sight.
The FSP-L2, FSP-L3, and FSP-L7 have multi-cell, multi-tier Fresnel lenses with a 360° view. This document describes the coverage 
patterns available with each lens. Coverages shown in the diagrams are maximum, measured in linear feet. They represent coverage 
for full-step walking motion, with no barriers or obstacles.
Passive Infrared Sensing in Warehouses
Warehouses can have ambient temperature variations that may affect sensor detection and coverage areas. High temperatures at the 
covered area (above 89-92°F) reduce the detection zone of the sensor. Consider adding more sensors if the ambient temperatures 
are expected to be high. Additionally, high floor level temperature may require larger movement for detection. In some cases, sensors 
mounted above 40’ may only detect large heat signatures such as forklift trucks.
See the Sensor Module Installation Instructions for a complete description of the assembled unit installation, wiring, and 
safety information.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Dimming Compatibility
For more details and recommended dimmer list, see Dimming Compatibility Information on currentlighting.com/lifeshield.
Central Inverters
For full fixture output in back-up mode, we recommend you visit currentlighting.com/dual-lite for your Central Lighting Inverter options. Please contact your local 
Current representative for any assistance with proper sizing and loading of your inverter selection. Central lighting inverters must be ordered separately. 
Bezel Trim
See installation instructions on currentlighting.com/lifeshield for complete details.
Lumen Output in Emergency Mode
To determine the lumen output in emergency mode multiply the battery pack wattage by the fixture lumens per watt (LPW). 
For example, 7W x 120 LPW = 840 lumens in emergency mode.

provide best in class distributions and maximum 
pole spacing in new applications with high 
powered LEDs.  Strike optics are held in place with 
a polycarbonate bezel to mimic the appearance 
of the Micro Strike Optics so both solutions can be 
combined on the same application. Catalog logic 
found on page 3
•	 Both optics maximize target zone illumination 
with minimal losses at the house-side, reducing 
light trespass issues.  Additional backlight control 
shields and house side shields can be added for 
further reduction of illumination behind the pole

FSP-Lx Lens Modules for FSP-2xx Series PIR Occupancy Sensors
Lens Coverage Guide
No: 24226 – 08/16  rev. 1
Catalog Number: FSP-L2/FSP-L3/FSP-L7
Country of Origin: Made in China
SPECIFICATIONS
Operating Temperature- .................... 40° to 167°F (-40° to 75°C
IP Rating when mounted to outdoor rated fixture 
................IP-66
DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION
The FSP-2xx occupancy sensor is modular, consisting of two parts, a Sensor Module  and a Lens. The Sensor Module is selected 
according to the type of power available in the installation, and the desired operational features. The Lens is selected based on the 
coverage desired for the sensor application.
Lens modules are IP-66 rated when combined with an FSP-2xx sensor mounted to an outdoor rated fixture.
Sensors must directly “see” motion of an occupant to detect them, so careful consideration must be given to sensor placement. Avoid 
placing the sensor where shelving or other obstructions may block the sensor’s line of sight.
The FSP-L2, FSP-L3, and FSP-L7 have multi-cell, multi-tier Fresnel lenses with a 360° view. This document describes the coverage 
patterns available with each lens. Coverages shown in the diagrams are maximum, measured in linear feet. They represent coverage 
for full-step walking motion, with no barriers or obstacles.
Passive Infrared Sensing in Warehouses
Warehouses can have ambient temperature variations that may affect sensor detection and coverage areas. High temperatures at the 
covered area (above 89-92°F) reduce the detection zone of the sensor. Consider adding more sensors if the ambient temperatures 
are expected to be high. Additionally, high floor level temperature may require larger movement for detection. In some cases, sensors 
mounted above 40’ may only detect large heat signatures such as forklift trucks.
See the Sensor Module Installation Instructions for a complete description of the assembled unit installation, wiring, and 
safety information.

FSP-Lx Lens Modules for FSP-2xx Series PIR Occupancy Sensors
Lens Coverage Guide
No: 24226 – 08/16  rev. 1
Catalog Number: FSP-L2/FSP-L3/FSP-L7
Country of Origin: Made in China
SPECIFICATIONS
Operating Temperature- .................... 40° to 167°F (-40° to 75°C
IP Rating when mounted to outdoor rated fixture 
................IP-66
DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION
The FSP-2xx occupancy sensor is modular, consisting of two parts, a Sensor Module  and a Lens. The Sensor Module is selected 
according to the type of power available in the installation, and the desired operational features. The Lens is selected based on the 
coverage desired for the sensor application.
Lens modules are IP-66 rated when combined with an FSP-2xx sensor mounted to an outdoor rated fixture.
Sensors must directly “see” motion of an occupant to detect them, so careful consideration must be given to sensor placement. Avoid 
placing the sensor where shelving or other obstructions may block the sensor’s line of sight.
The FSP-L2, FSP-L3, and FSP-L7 have multi-cell, multi-tier Fresnel lenses with a 360° view. This document describes the coverage 
patterns available with each lens. Coverages shown in the diagrams are maximum, measured in linear feet. They represent coverage 
for full-step walking motion, with no barriers or obstacles.
Passive Infrared Sensing in Warehouses
Warehouses can have ambient temperature variations that may affect sensor detection and coverage areas. High temperatures at the 
covered area (above 89-92°F) reduce the detection zone of the sensor. Consider adding more sensors if the ambient temperatures 
are expected to be high. Additionally, high floor level temperature may require larger movement for detection. In some cases, sensors 
mounted above 40’ may only detect large heat signatures such as forklift trucks.
See the Sensor Module Installation Instructions for a complete description of the assembled unit installation, wiring, and 
safety information.

FSP-Lx Lens Modules for FSP-2xx Series PIR Occupancy Sensors
Lens Coverage Guide
No: 24226 – 08/16  rev. 1
Catalog Number: FSP-L2/FSP-L3/FSP-L7
Country of Origin: Made in China
SPECIFICATIONS
Operating Temperature- .................... 40° to 167°F (-40° to 75°C
IP Rating when mounted to outdoor rated fixture 
................IP-66
DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION
The FSP-2xx occupancy sensor is modular, consisting of two parts, a Sensor Module  and a Lens. The Sensor Module is selected 
according to the type of power available in the installation, and the desired operational features. The Lens is selected based on the 
coverage desired for the sensor application.
Lens modules are IP-66 rated when combined with an FSP-2xx sensor mounted to an outdoor rated fixture.
Sensors must directly “see” motion of an occupant to detect them, so careful consideration must be given to sensor placement. Avoid 
placing the sensor where shelving or other obstructions may block the sensor’s line of sight.
The FSP-L2, FSP-L3, and FSP-L7 have multi-cell, multi-tier Fresnel lenses with a 360° view. This document describes the coverage 
patterns available with each lens. Coverages shown in the diagrams are maximum, measured in linear feet. They represent coverage 
for full-step walking motion, with no barriers or obstacles.
Passive Infrared Sensing in Warehouses
Warehouses can have ambient temperature variations that may affect sensor detection and coverage areas. High temperatures at the 
covered area (above 89-92°F) reduce the detection zone of the sensor. Consider adding more sensors if the ambient temperatures 
are expected to be high. Additionally, high floor level temperature may require larger movement for detection. In some cases, sensors 
mounted above 40’ may only detect large heat signatures such as forklift trucks.
See the Sensor Module Installation Instructions for a complete description of the assembled unit installation, wiring, and 
safety information.

The Smart Choice
Rigid Aluminum Conduit Is The Smart Choice.
* Applicable Tolerances - Outside Diameter 1/2"" to 1-1/2"": +/- 0.015""; 2” to 6"": +/- 1%. ** For information only. Not a standards requirement.
*** Rigid Aluminum Conduit is manufactured to produce a 10' length of conduit when a standard coupling is attached.
Specification Data: Rigid Aluminum Conduit
• Aluminum Alloy: 6063, T-1 Temper
• Meets the provisions of the Buy American Act
• Custom lengths longer than 10 feet available
• 
UL listed to UL6A Safety Standard 	
(Steel UL6 Equivalent)
• Meets ANSI C80.5 Standard
Lower Cost
Our rigid aluminum conduit can lower costs and 
increase profits compared to using steel conduit. 
The lower cost of aluminum alloy and processing 
results in significant product cost savings over 
steel, while meeting all UL standards.
100% Recyclable
The proven environmental benefits of aluminum result from its recyclability. Nearly 75% of all aluminum alloy 
produced is still in use today. Penn Aluminum Conduit products are made from recycled aluminum. Both 
jobsite scrap and end-of-life product may be recycled and maintain monetary value.
Reduced Labor
At 1/3 the weight of galvanized steel, Penn 
Aluminum Conduit makes installation faster and 
easier, requiring fewer people. It is estimated 
that labor cost savings of 30% to 70% are 
achievable compared to rigid steel conduit.
Non-Corrosive
Aluminum is naturally non-corrosive, offering 
outstanding protection for wiring in most  
applications. When aluminum oxidizes, a  
protective barrier is formed. In contrast,  
xidation causes steel conduit to rust.
Enhanced Safety
Penn Rigid Aluminum Conduit is much safer 
for installers to use due to its significantly 
lighter weight than the same size of steel 
conduit. It’s easier foremployees to work with, 
reduces fatigue and lowers the risk of injury.
Non-Sparking
Aluminum is a non-sparking, non-ferrous metal, 
eliminating the risk of explosion from sparks 
in combustible environments. It also provides 
inherent EMI shielding and offers greater  
dissipation of heat compared to steel.
Versatile Material
The many benefits of aluminum conduit, along 
with its superior attractive appearance, make it 
the smart choice to replace steel in virtually all 
electrical raceway applications.

Recommended Practices
Specification Data: Aluminum Electrical Metallic Tubing (EMT)
•  UL listed to UL797A Safety Standard (Steel UL797 Equivalent)
•  Meets ANSI C80.3 and Federal Specifications
•  Aluminum Alloy: 6063
•  Meets the provisions of the Buy American Act
Bending – Standard EMT bending equipment may be used for  
fabrication of Penn Aluminum EMT. We recommend maintaining  
consistent foot pressure when using hand benders and to use the  
arm as a guide only. Penn Aluminum EMT requires less force to  
bend than galvanized steel EMT.
Cutting – Use industry standard EMT cutting tools. Aluminum EMT alloy 
offers efficient and rapid cuts, allowing tooling to last longer.
Fittings – UL514B Safety Standard states that galvanized steel and zinc die cast fittings are permitted  
to be used with Aluminum EMT. Reference NEC handbook 358.14 for more information. 
Wire Pulling/Fishing – It is recommended that round fiberglass fish tape be utilized for smaller wire  
bundle sizes. Polypropylene rope may be considered for larger bundle pulls.
                               – Penn Aluminum EMT can also be ordered with our factory-applied Blue Lightning 
 friction-reducing coating for improved wire pulling.

DESCRIPTION 
The LC8 lighting controller automatically switches a dry 
contact in response to changes in natural daylight. The 
LC8 provides a maintained single pole, double throw 
“form C” relay output to drive electrically held contactors 
or relays, or inputs to Energy Management Systems (EMS). 
The LC8 can control incandescent, fluorescent or HID 
lighting. The low voltage controller requires a remotely 
mounted CES or MAS sensor. 
The dual setpoint LC8 precisely switches loads according 
to the selected light level configuration. LOW and HIGH 
light levels are calibrated to their setpoints at the control 
board. As the sensor detects a diminishing light level that 
corresponds with the LOW setpoint, the control board 
matches the two signals and the lights are switched ON. 
As the sensor detects an increased light level, the control 
board’s HIGH setpoint switches the lights OFF
. The LOW 
and HIGH setpoints are separated by a “deadband”. This 
prevents the sensor from switching light levels between the 
setpoints, thus eliminating nuisance or intermittent changes.
For direct switching capability of 120VAC and 277VAC cir­
cuits, the LC8 can be used with a switchpack. PLCBuildings 
UL listed PCS/120 or PCS/277 may be used. All products are 
factory tested to assure maximum reliability. The advantages 
of using the LC8 lighting control system are found in stabil­
ity, versatility, quality and accuracy. The LC8 offers precision 
light measurement setpoints that are stable once set and the 
flexibility to be applied to many different lighting environ­
ments.

301 CES Rev7
DESCRIPTION
The CES is a three wire, analog photosensor which provides a light 
level input to lighting control and building automation systems. Four 
models are available for different parts of a building (Indoor, Atrium, 
Skylight and Outdoor). Four output ranges are available: 0-5VDC, 
0-10VDC, 1-5VDC and 1-10VDC. This makes the CES well-suited for 
implementing daylight harvesting with most lighting control systems. 
Custom wire lengths, lens and housing modifications, and multi-point 
NIST calibration services are also available.
BASIC OPERATION
Sensors are powered by either 1
2 or 24VDC. Each sensor’s 5 or 
10VDC output is calibrated to a factory standard footcandle setting 
using NIST traceable equipment. All CES sensors are Class 2 wiring 
devices and are listed as UL916 accessory equipment.
APPLICATIONS
•	
Indoor sensors: interior spaces such as offices and classrooms
•	 Outdoor sensors: sign and site illumination control
•	
Atrium sensors: atrium lit spaces such as lobbies
•	
Skylight sensors: spaces illuminated via skylilghts such as
warehouses
•	
Low range indoor: spaces requiring daytime contrast lighting
control

sensor set point limits and time schedules which are saved in 
flash memory. Adjustments to the settings and schedules can 
be made with pushbuttons on the controller face. 
Timed functions are controlled by an internal real-time clock.  
The battery-backed clock is accurate to one second per month 
and can be adjusted for drift.  Timed circuits are automatically 
adjusted for daylight savings time and leap year unless 
otherwise specified. 
The LCM-IE series advantages include stability, versatility, 
quality and accuracy.  Once mounted, the sensor, power, and 
lighting loads need only to be wired and the LCM is ready to 
operate. The system controller has specific application control 
strategies that are matched with the appropriate sensor to 
create optimal packaging and system efficiency.

          301 Lodestar Rev3
DESCRIPTION
The LODESTAR Standalone Twist-lock Controller is 
designed to provide basic control for outdoor lighting, 
a “set it, and forget it” solution.  Set at the factory and 
adjustable in the field, LODESTAR provides an easy way 
to reduce energy expenses through the use of daylight 
sensing technology.
Each device has three selectable dimming levels (30%, 
50%, or 70%) with three different start times (10:00 pm, 
1
2:00 midnight, or 2:00 am) which are configurable 
through the 10-position selector switch on the bottom 
of the device.   Simply plug LODESTAR into an existing 
NEMA C1
36.41 twist-lock dimming receptacle, and the 
advanced algorithm automatically adjusts for local time 
synchronization and daylight savings.
Adding LODESTAR to your outdoor lighting is an easy way to 
reduce energy consumption and comply with current energy 
standards. It is also a cost effective solution for use in areas 
subject to mandatory light level reductions.  Unsurpassed 
construction, electrical, process and environmental protections 
make this outdoor dimming controller the highest grade twist-lock 
photocontrol available.

OVERVIEW 
The Cadence family of wall switch occupancy sensors provides a simple yet cost effective lighting control solution 
for many retrofit applications. Designed with contractors in mind, the Cadence wall switch sensor is significantly 
shallower than typical sensors, resulting in less crowed wall boxes. Additionally, versatile wiring enables usage 
with or without a neutral and allows reversal of line and load connections. Cadence products utilize the latest 
passive infrared technology and digital signal processing techniques to provide unmatched motion detection 
performance. These units are also available with an integrated microphone to provide overlapping passive acoustic 
occupancy detection for rooms with obstructions or where occupant motion is limited. 
BASIC OPERATION 
Sensors detect movement in the infrared energy that radiates from occupants as they move within the devices 
field-of-view. Once occupancy is identified, the sensor’s internal relay switches power on to the connected 
lighting. Units can also be configured to operate in Vacancy Mode (e.g., require lights be manually switched on). 
Once lights are on and if equipped with passive dual technology (PIR/Acoustic), the unit’s microphone is enabled 
to further enhance detection. An internal timer is set to keep lights on during brief periods of inactivity, and is 
reset every time occupancy is signaled by either the passive infrared or acoustic detection technologies. Ambient 
daylight detection can also be enabled in equipped units so that lights are held off in rooms with sufficient light 
contribution from windows or skylights.

APPLICATIONS
A wall switch sensor is typically used to retrofit an existing wall switch in a small room 
or enclosed space. A Passive Infrared (PIR) only sensor is sufficient for spaces where line 
of site is maintained and occupants are periodically moving (e.g., copy rooms, storage 
rooms). Dual technology sensors are necessary where occupants may be partially blocked 
from the sensor’s direct view or where they may be stationary (e.g., private offices or 
restrooms with stalls).
CODE COMPLIANCE
Wall Switch sensors can be used to meet many 
requirements of ASHRAE 90.1 
(2016), IECC (2015), and Title 24 (2016).

MULTI-GANG SWITCH REPLACEMENT
Many residential and commercial building spaces contain multi-gang switch locations (i.e. locations on the wall that have more than one single-gang switch devices in the same wall box). 
The Cadence solution for these applications utilizes a wall switch occupancy sensor and one or more added “sidecar” wall switches that receives necessary occupancy information from 
the adjacent sensor. Each unit can be configured separately for Auto On or Manual On (Vacancy) operation and time delay. Most conveniently, this solution enables adding a standard 
multi-gang decorator switch plate in order to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance without any awkward and conspicuous blank wall plate sections. Additional sidecar switches 
can also be added to create 3-pole (or greater) solutions.

INBOARD / OUTBOARD SWITCH REPLACEMENT 
Many older buildings have fluorescent light fixtures wired for inboard/outboard control 
by a pair of wall switches. Retrofitting these wall switches with code-compliant controls 
is attractively done with a Cadence 2-pole solution (model: #OCS-102 or OCS-122). 
These two unit kits contain an Auto On occupancy sensor and a Manual On sidecar 
switch that work together to meet the required partial on energy code requirements.
BATHROOM LIGHTS & FAN 
Bathrooms often have separate switches for lights and ventilation fans. In some cases 
two switches for lights (e.g. vanity and shower) and the fan are all contained in the same 
3-gang wall box along the entry wall. Retrofitting these switches with a Cadence wall 
switch sensor and two sidecar switches is an attractive and energy efficient solution for 
providing occupancy control of all three loads.

OPERATIONAL MODES
SENSORWORX wall switch sensors are intelligent devices that provide both excellent 
energy savings and enhanced user convenience. Users can choose from several pre-
programmed operational modes that best fit their preferences and applicable energy 
codes. Note that both the master wall switch sensor unit and sidecar switch unit in 
2-Pole solution (OCS-102, OCS-122)  have independent operational modes.	


	
	

	
	

	
Vacancy Mode 
Manual On / Automatic Off operation. Lights can also be switched off manually. 
This mode provides increased energy savings but requires the user to initially turn on 
the lights. Models OCS-103, OCS-104, OCS-123, and OCS-124 default to Vacancy 
modes. Sidecar switch units (OCS-831-SC) in 2-Pole kits also default to Vacancy 
mode.
Occupancy Mode 
Automatic On and Automatic Off operation. If lights are switched off manually, the 
Automatic On functionality is temporarily disabled to allow the occupant a few 
seconds to leave the room before returning to Automatic On operation. However, 
if the person remains in the space, the unit will stay in a manual on state until the 
switch is pressed again. This mode is the default operation of OCS-101, OCS-111, 
OCS-121, and OCS-131 models. 
Automatic On w/ Exit Time Mode 
Automatic On and Automatic Off operation. If lights are switched off manually, the 
Automatic On functionality is disabled for a fixed 30 seconds to allow a person time 
to leave the room.
Override Off Mode 
Automatic On and Automatic Off operation until lights are switched off manually, at 
which point Automatic On functionality is disabled until the switch is pressed again.
Disabled Switch Mode 
Automatic On and Automatic Off operation only. Switch functionality to manually turn 
on/off lights is disabled.
Presentation Mode 
If lights are switched off manually, the Automatic On functionality is disabled until 
the space becomes unoccupied and the sensor’s time delay expires.

Peak-Current Power Capability
Today’s sophisticated systems draw alternating
current in a high-peak, non-linear mode. During
normal operation,these peaks are a result of the
DC power supplies, which repeatedly draw cur-
rent to recharge their storage capacitors.
Ordinary power conditioners typically have a
high forward transfer impedance, causing sine
wave distortion whenever peak current is
required. OnLine Power Conditioners have 3 to
5% impedance that minimizes this distortion.
Highest Energy Efficiency
OnLine Power Conditioners efficiency range is
96% at full load to 98.5% at light loads. This is
remarkable when other types of power condi-
tioning devices are 85% efficient at full load and
only 67% efficient at half load. The higher effi-
ciency of OnLine Power Conditioners provides
significant savings in operating costs. The Power
Conditioner pays for itself in just a few years.
Protection Against Electrical
Noise
Electrical noise consists of spurious electrical
signals which enter power lines from such
sources as lightning, utility network switching
and the operation of countless electrical
devices. Noise is so prevalent that it accounts
for nearly 90% of all problem causing power dis-
turbances.
Noise signals can cause computing
errors, printing errors, improper data transfer
and damage to sensitive circuit components.
Power line noise is transmitted in two different
forms:
common-mode, and transverse-mode
(normal-mode).
OnLine Power Conditioners
offer protection against both types.

Zero Current Switching
OnLine Power Conditioners are highly reliable,
and the primary reason is their zero current
tap-switching technology. A tap-switching, fully
isolated, power conditioner, regulates voltage
by switching electrical taps to either raise or
lower the output voltage.
Since these tap
changes are made when the current is at zero,
there is virtually no component stress. This
innovative zero current tap-switching tech-
nique results in exceptional system reliability.
Protection Against High & Low
Voltage
Sensitive equipment located in heavily industri-
alized areas require protection against inter-
mittent voltage sags and surges caused by the
frequent turning on and off of heavy industrial
equipment such as motors.
Since a sudden
voltage sag or surge can occur at any moment,
it is imperative that a power conditioner
respond to voltage fluctuations quickly and
accurately.
OnLine Power Conditioners have a wide input
range (+10% to -26% of nominal) and a narrow
output range (+3% of the nominal output volt-
age).
A voltage measuring circuit in each control
assembly senses the amplitude of the input
voltage and a digital logic network determines
whether the voltage is within acceptable limits
for proper load operation. If not, the logic cir-
cuit selects the proper electrical tap for bring-
ing the voltage back to within the critical load’s
requirements.

Built to LAST
The conservative design and rating parameters
of the CP6 permit it to attain an unprecedented
30 years of continuous operation. Designed to
be first in quality, second to none in value and to
last well into the 21st century.
Cost Effective
In the real world, regulators are typically loaded
at no more than 65 to 80 percent of their power
rating. Under these conditions, CP6 technology
is 20% more efficient than competing ferroreso-
nant/magnetic synthesizer technology.
Convention Cooled Transformer
The CP6 transformer is convection cooled. This
is the fail-safe, highly effective means whereby
the CP6 maintains a 220˚C insulation rating.
Under full load and low line conditions, the sys-
tem can operate in a 40˚C environment indefi-
nitely while sustaining periodic 50˚C tempera-
ture rises.

Rear Panel Output Receptacles
Configuration (Std. 1 each 520R2)
Right Choice
The CP6 is the right choice for those who
want maximum flexibility.  It may be pow-
ered via a hard-wired junction box or
plugged into a standard electrical outlet.
The caster base on the CP6 provides ease
of mobility.  It may be equipped with most
NEMA or Hubbell type receptacles.  These
receptacles may be installed on the back
panel or at the end of OnLine’s liquid-tight,
UL approved conduit in any length.  Six
LED’s indicate at a glance which trans-
former tap is being selected by the SCR’s
for regulation.  A bypass switch is standard
on all units for ease of maintenance.
A voltage spike of even a few milliseconds
duration is enough to destroy data or
equipment.  That is why more and more
business systems are relying on the CP6.  
Powerful voltage irregularities, such as
common mode and transverse mode
noise, are cleaned up by the CP6’s heavy-
duty input and output filters.  But most of
the dirty voltage and noise never make it to
the output filters because they are snuffed
out by the dual-shielded high-isolation
transformer.
Voltage sags and surges are held up and
mowed down by the transformer’s six 3%
taps.  A bank of SCR’s can be counted on to
provide smooth tap-switching with input
swings from +10 to -26% of nominal.
Switching only occurs at the zero current
crossing of the AC cycle to deliver regula-
tion without a hitch.

P-877,https://www.onlinepower.com/pdf/fab_DS.pdf,No,"Sine Wave Power for the 21st Century
The Fire Alarm Backup System delivers computer-
grade, sine-wave power; the preferred power
source for all electronic equipment. With today’s
advanced technology, we can combine inverter
and battery charger into a single modular with
reliable electrical equipment utilize digital signal
processing including electrical static transfer
switch.
PWMT
echnology
The double conversion inverter of the Fire Alarm
Backup System (FAB) is always on-line, eliminating
noise, spikes, sags, and brownouts. Should utility
power fail, the UPS’s inverter provides no-break,
uninterrupted output power to the critical load.
This high frequency unit is listed to UL1481.
Input Power Factor Correction
The Fire Alarm Backup System pays for itself by
correcting input current draw to reduce your util-
ity bill without compromising power quality.
Latest Technology for Switch-Mode Power
Supplies
The Fire Alarm Backup System model is designed
for switch mode power supplies, computer loads, with
no derating, drawing sine-wave input current that is
power factor corrected.
Microprocessor Control Display
The FireAlarm Backup System provides one of the
most comprehensive monitoring package. Its 40 X
4 line back lit display shows multiple readings with
remote monitoring through RS232 or AS400.
Safegard™Battery Management System
OnLine Power has designed (patent pending) a
process for the real time ability to charge and
monitor the battery system. This system utilizes a
microprocessor technology to monitor the bat-
teries critical levels and apply charging cycles in a
method to substantially increase battery life.
Isolation, Including Output Neutral T
o Ground
Bonding
The Fire Alarm Backup System provides the gal-
vanic electrical isolation required by FIPS PUB 94
(Federal Information Processing Standard) and it
qualifies as a true, separately derived power
source as defined by the National Electrical Code,
Article 250-5d. When input is different from out-
put or output different from input, an internally
mounted transformer is required. This isolation
allows the Fire Alarm Backup System to offer
excellent RF noise filtering and single point
grounding for sensitive electronic equipment
(standard on all models with output transformer)
Caster Based, Small Footprint Cabinet
The Fire Alarm Backup System requires less com-
puter room floorspace than most other UPS sys-
tem. Its compact. lightweight design saves overall
space, facilitates handling and keeps shipping costs
to a minimum.
Alarms
T
o alert you of possible problems, the Fire Alarm
Backup System displays alarm messages on its con-
trol panel and provides RS232/AS400 local out-
puts and T
erminal Block for Remote Monitoring.

Peak-Current Power
Capability
T
oday’s sophisticated systems draw alter-
nating current in a peak, non-linear mode.
During normal operation, these peaks are a
result of the DC power supplies, known as
switching power supplies, which repeatedly
draw current to recharge their storage
capacitors.  Ordinary power conditioners
typically have a high forward transfer
impedance, which causes sine wave distor-
tion whenever peak current is required.
OnLine Power’s Iso-Care has 3 to 5% (low)
impedance that minimizes this distortion.
Solutions to Power Line
Disturbance
Common-Mode Noise Protection
Computers using ground as a reference for
logic circuits can encounter interference
from common-mode noise.  This type of
noise is a voltage disturbance found
between both current carrying leads and
the common ground wire.
Transverse-Mode Noise Protection
Transverse-mode noise is not as easily elim-
inated as common-mode noise.
It is found between the phase and neutral
input leads.  
Transverse voltage can be found
on the secondary winding of a power trans-
former generated from the primary winding
and coupled to the secondary.  The Iso-
Care provides significant transverse-mode
noise attenuation by reducing the high fre-
quency noise between the input and the
output windings of the transformer.

Protection Against Electrical Noise
Electrical noise consists of spurious electrical signals
which enter power lines from such sources as lightning,
utility network switching and the operation of count-
less electrical devices.
Noise is so prevalent that it accounts for nearly 90% of
all problem causing power disturbances.  Noise signals
can cause computing errors, printing errors, improper
data transfer and damage to sensitive circuit compo-
nents.
Power line noise is transmitted in two different forms.
The first one known as common-mode noise, and the
second one known as transverse-mode (normal-mode)
noise. OnLine Power’s Iso-Care and Iso-Care Plus
offers protection against both types.
The Iso-Care utilizes two Faraday shields per phase to
achieve -120 dB of common-mode noise attenuation.
The isolation transformer also achieves -20 dB per
decade transverse (normal) mode noise attenuation.
The Iso-Care Plus utilizes multi-shields per phase to
achieve -126 dB of common-mode noise attenuation.
An optional attenuation of -140 dB and -152 dB is avail-
able.  The isolation transformer with input filter
achieves    -40 dB per decade transverse (normal)
mode noise attenuation.  With input and output filter
Iso-Care Plus can achieve -60 dB per decade, trans-
verse (normal) mode.
Power Line Disturbances
A major cause of computer malfunctions and the fail-
ure of other sensitive equipment is electrical noise.
Power line disturbances occur every day.  Dirty power
can seriously impair the performance of sub-miniatur-
ized systems and computer micro-circuits by causing
program errors and memory loss.

ONE HOUR ASSEMBLY WITH E.Z. BARRIER
In the event of a fire, the opening in the sheetrock along the outside edge 
of a recessed light fixture is not protected from fire. A seal must be es­
tablished to maintain the integrity of the one-hour assembly. The IC rated 
fixture, although rated, is not rated to protect the integrity of the assembly.

NON-RATED ASSEMBLY WITH E.Z. BARRIER
This is an approved installation in a non-rated floor/ceiling assembly. How­
ever, heat buildup around the fixture has shown to reduce bulb fife and set 
off heat sensors.
Using e.z. barrier in a non-rated assembly allows you to use a non-rated 
fixture and provide an air space around the fixture for cooler operating 
temperatures.

The e.z. barrier fire box will maintain the one-hour 
fire rating required for installation of recessed light 
fixtures and other devices within a rated assem­
bly. e.z. barrier’s simple, practical design creates 
substantial savings in installation costs per project 
in the field. 
More importantly, e.z. barrier provides a multitude of options for recessed applications in all of 
your design projects. It takes away the limitations driven by high installation costs from building 
gypsum-board fire boxes that are not fire rated. e.z. barrier is flexible in that it can be used in 16” 
and 24” on-center applications. It will also be available in other depths and sizes.
Intertek certified e.z. barrier fire box to the American Society for Testing and Materials specifica­
tion ASTM E11900a Standard Methods of Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials. e.z. 
barrier fire box also meets the following fire-related specifications: UL 263, UBC 7-1, NFPA 251,

The Only Fire-Rated Multi-Use Fire 
Barrier for Electrical Openings
The traditional way of ensuring that you meet fire codes 
with recessed lighting is to hand-build fire boxes around 
each and every light you install. Building one box can 
take up to an hour, which can quickly add up to hundreds 
of labor hours in a typical building.
e.z. barrier fire box makes recessed lights a snap. You’ll 
install recessed lights in a fraction of the time. In the time 
it takes to fasten four screws, your box is ready to go. 
Install your light and you’re on to the next one. It’s that 
simple.
Benefits
Save substantial dollars on every 
job site in labor and material costs 
and ensure integrity of one-hour fire 
rated assemblies with commercial 
building code requirements.

This is an approved installation in a non-rated assembly. However, heat buildup around a fixture has shown to 
reduce bulb life and set off heat sensors. Additionally, installation is not air tight and will allow moisture to enter 
into the attic. In colder environments, this can result in frost buildup on the underside of the roof deck.

The ProMelt Smart Controller operates hydronic and electric heating equipment designed to melt snow and/or ice from roads and 
walkway surfaces. The control works with the Snow/Ice Sensor 090 or Snow Sensor 095 to automatically detect snow or ice and oper-
ates a single boiler, steam valve, or electric cable to supply heat to the slab. When connected to the Internet, the Watts® Home mobile 
app allows the ProMelt Smart Controller to be controlled remotely.

Zone Cabling ROI
While dependent upon the exact number of 
moves, 
adds, 
and 
changes 
(MACs) 
performed per year, typical zone cabling 
plants of any size planned with 25% spare 
port availability not only significantly reduce 
client disruption, but allow the building owner 
to recoup the cost of the extra port capacity 
within a two to five year span or after reach-
ing the ROI threshold (i.e. either 14 moves 
and 17 adds or 16 moves and 20 adds 
depending upon cabling type). For more 
information and a detailed cost analysis on 
traditional vs. zone cabling please see 
Siemon’s whitepaper titled: Zone Cabling for 
Cost Savings” at www.siemon.com.

Designed by Chicago architect Stephen Katz in 2014, the Eliza–H ceiling-mount fan blends a beautiful 
technically derived form with superior function and movement. The unique blade shape is designed to 
maximize air movement at the outer edge of the blade. The result is more efficient air velocity rings, less 
blade drag and greater motor optimization. Equally important is Eliza–H’s stationary visual statement 
which combines modern utility with minimalist geometry. Constructed of cast aluminum and heavy 
stamped steel, the Eliza–H has a limited lifetime warranty.

Like satellites orbiting a planet, the Brisa’s select mahogany blade head and lunar counterweight gently 
revolve 360° about its spherical gear housing. The fan head can be infinitely positioned in a 180-degree 
arc for optimum air movement; the greater the angle of the motor to the horizontal support rods (up or 
down), the faster the axial rotation. A slow, controlled axial rotation is achieved by both fan head position 
and fan blade speed. Matthews 360° rotational fans circulate heat and air conditioning more efficiently 
than traditional paddle fans. Constructed of cast aluminum, heavy spun and stamped steel, the Brisa 
carries a limited lifetime warranty.

OVERVIEW
The Micro Sensor with 2-wire adaptor is a complete sensing and lighting control node 
powered from its attached light fixture. An innovative carrier-based mounting design 
supports easy installation and replacement. With integrated wireless communications for 
data transmission and remote configuration as well as autonomous fixture-level control, 
this sensor brings advanced lighting automation to a whole new level.
FEATURES AND BENEFITS
Approvals: Plenum rated and UL 2403 recognized.
2-Wire Driver Compatibility: With the included adaptor cable, the sensor is easily 
connected to compatible LED drivers, simplifying installation, reducing wiring errors, and 
providing plug-and-play capabilities.  Compatible LED drivers include traditional DALI 
drivers with an external or integrated Power Supply Unit (PSU).
Localized Lighting Control: Light-level schedules, preferences, and behavior profiles for 
each fixture are wirelessly communicated during system setup and locally stored to ensure 
continuous operation.
Edge Sensing: Local processing capability supports advanced sensing and detection 
algorithms, providing optimization of existing features and enabling future applications.
Bluetooth Low Energy: An embedded BLE radio allows the sensor to receive and transmit 
beacons as well as support communication with lighting control devices and other sensors. 
Occupancy and Thermal Sensing: A digital Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor combined with 
separate ambient and temperature sensing support precise motion identification while 
minimizing false detection events.
Tunable White: Compatible with DALI Type 8 dual-channel drivers to support tunable 
white fixtures, enabling color temperature transitions based on time of day or user control.  
Daylight Harvesting: Captured ambient light information is locally processed to raise and 
lower light levels based on available daylight.
Room and Zone Control: Pairs with room control switches for code-compliant manual-on 
or auto-off capability. Sensors can be grouped into zones that share occupancy sensing 
data and coordinate light control based on detected motion.
IoT Sensing Node: When configured as an IoT Node, the sensor streams comprehensive 
live data for use with Enlighted's real-time location and analytics software applications. 
This option is available directly from the factory or as a remote upgrade.
Standards-Based Networking and Security: The Enlighted 802.15.4 wireless network

MOUNTING
The Enlighted Micro Sensor is designed to be easily mounted into lighting fixtures or ceiling 
tiles such that only the discreet white faceplate is visible. The sensor slides into a carrier sleeve 
(included) fitting a standard 1/2 inch trade size knockout or 7/8 inch (22 mm) hole. Carrier 
sleeves compatible with either lighting fixtures or ceiling tiles are available. Sensor replacement 
requires no tools or opening of the light fixture—simply slide the sensor out of the carrier, unplug 
the connector, and install the new sensor.
SENSOR COVERAGE PATTERNS
The Enlighted Micro Sensor incorporates an optical Fresnel lens that works with the digital Passive 
Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect occupancy and motion.  The multifaceted lens focuses light onto the 
PIR to produce an all-encompassing field of view through aggregation of many narrow fields of view.   
When the Micro Sensor is deployed as recommended, the area covered by each sensor overlaps, 
reinforcing coverage and accuracy across the entire floor plan.

Solid State Percentage Timer
The operation of the new 304GX Percentage Timer is similar to the 304G 
with several noteworthy enhancements. The accuracy of the 304GX has 
been improved to 1% of range. With the Cycle Progress Memory fea-
ture, when power is removed and restored during the cycle, the 304GX 
will continue the cycle without resetting. The latching relay only changes 
state when the cycle reaches the set point or the end of the cycle.
CONTACTS: The relay contact is capable of switching 10 A to a resistive 
120 VAC or 30 VDC load. It is capable of driving a 1/3 HP load at 120 
VAC.
CYCLE PROGRESS INDICATION: The 304GX has a pilot light that is on 
solid during the relay off time. It blinks at a faster rate during the relay 
on time: once every 3.2 seconds during the first 10% of the cycle, twice 
­
during the second 25% and so on.
HIGH ACCURACY: The 304GX’s timing circuit is not a simple RC circuit. It 
utilizes the ­
microprocessor that includes counting technology along with 
a stable crystal oscillator to provide repeatable time delays. 
CONVENIENT ADJUSTMENT: Graduated in easily read 1% increments, 
the 304GX provides continuous adjustment of on time between 1 and 
99%.
The 304GX comes standard in the 60 SEC range but is user ­
configurable 
for the 15 SEC, 30 SEC, 120 SEC or MIN by jumpers from the PC board. 
Each of these ranges can also be made ­
minutes range by a jumper. 
Its solid-state circuitry repeatedly closes the SPST load switch for a 
percentage of the time cycle, as set on the timer dial, and opens it for 
the ­
remainder of the cycle.
When the dial pointer is set below 1%, the load switch stays open for 
the full cycle; it remains closed when the pointer is set above 99%. This 
is true for all seconds and minutes.
If power is interrupted, the 304GX timer will not reset and the relay 
state will not change. When power is restored, the timer will continue the 
interrupted cycles.

OPERATION
The 304G solid-state percentage timer comes standard in a 120 SEC 
range with 15 SEC, 30 SEC, 60 SEC user configurable ranges. Addition­
ally, all second ranges can become minute ranges by changing jumper 
J11 . The 304G is easily panel ­
mounted with 4 screws. It utilizes an 
integrated circuit ­
technology for high accuracy timing.
CONTACTS: The relay contact is capable of switching 10 A to a resistive 
120 VAC or 30 VDC load. It is capable of driving a 1/3 HP load at 
120 VAC.
CYCLE PROGRESS INDICATION: The 304G has a pilot light that is on 
solid during the relay off time. It blinks at a faster rate during the relay 
on time: once every 3.5 seconds during the first 10% of the cycle, twice 
­
during the second 10% and so on.
HIGH ACCURACY: The 304G’s timing circuit is not a simple RC circuit. 
It utilizes the ­
sophistication of a proprietary integrated circuit that 
includes counting technology along with a stable oscillator to provide 
repeatable time delays. 
CONVENIENT ADJUSTMENT: Graduated in easily read 1% increments, 
the 304G provides continuous adjustment of on time between 
5 and 95%.
The 304G comes standard in the 120 SEC range but is user ­
configurable 
for the 15 SEC, 30 SEC or MIN., 60 SEC or MIN. by changing jumpers on 
the PC board. Each of these ranges can also be made ­
minutes range by 
changing a jumper. Its solid-state circuitry repeatedly closes the SPST 
load switch for a percentage of the time cycle, as set on the timer dial, 
and opens it for the ­
remainder of the cycle.
When the dial pointer is set below 3%, the load switch stays open for 
the full cycle; it remains closed when the pointer is set above 98%. This 
is true for all seconds ranges. Minute ranges have a 0.01% minimum.
If power is interrupted to the timer it will reset. When power is restored, 
the timer will begin a new time cycle.

OPERATION
Easily the most rugged and dependable of industrial ­
percentage
timers, the ATC 304 incorporates heavy-duty contacts that are capable 
of switching loads as large as 4.6 KW directly.
LARGE CONTACTS: Self-cleaning silver contacts are 3/8 inch in
diameter, larger than in any other make of percentage timer. They
easily provide 1,000,000 operations at the full rated load of 25 A 
(non plug-in models).
RUGGED AND TROUBLE-FREE: Every component of the 304 has been 
refined and improved over the years to provide dependable operation 
for at least 3,000,000 cycles. Its classic ­
simplicity of design makes it 
­
virtually trouble-free.
CONVENIENT ADJUSTMENT: Graduated in easily read 1% increments, 
the 304 provides ­
continuous ­
adjustment of on time between 5 and 
95%. It also switches the load off ­
continuously when the pointer is set 
below 3%; and on continuously, when the pointer is set above 98%.
The 304 is available in a choice of 15, 30 and 60-second time 
cycles (60 Hz). Its synchronous motor drives a cam which repeat­
edly closes the SPST load switch for a percentage of the time 
cycle, as set on the timer dial, and opens it for the remainder of 
the cycle.
When the dial pointer is set below 3%, the load switch stays open 
for the full cycle; it remains closed when the pointer is set above 
98%. An optional Hold switch also disconnects power to the timer 
motor when the pointer is set below 3%.
Series 304 timers operate continuously and do not reset on 
power interruption; when power is restored, they resume the 
interrupted cycle.
TYPICAL APPLICATIONS: Ideal for controlling wattage input to 
electrically heated equipment, the 304 non-plug-in models can 
pulse loads up to 4.6 KW directly through the SPST load switch; 
the plug-in models can switch up to 2.3 KW loads directly.
The 304 can be used with other types of electrical equipment to 
control the ratio of on time and off time in a fixed time cycle. In 
many types of ratio and cascade control systems, the 304
provides rate-of-rise set point drive control; special dial 
­
calibrations are available for this application.

Motor-Driven Analog Reset Timer
Noted for its circuit flexibility, the 305 also provides the highest 
accuracy among analog timers. Available for either ON-Delay or OFF-
Delay operation.
The 305 provides delay, interval or pulse timing ­
function for up to 
7 load circuits through two instantaneous and two delayed switches. 
It features a plug-in design and cycle progress indication.
HIGHEST ACCURACY: Because of its exclusive infinite engagement 
clutch, the 305 has a repeat accuracy of 0.2%, highest of any timer in 
its class.
PLUG-IN AND DUST-TIGHT DESIGN: By virtue of its true plug-in design, 
the body of a 305 can be replaced in seconds without disturbing the 
housing or disconnecting the wiring. Its gasketed dial assembly forms a 
dust-tight seal against the housing, whether panel or surface-mounted.
FASTEST RESET: All 305 timers reset to a full-scale setting within 0.1 
second, proportionately faster for shorter settings.
CIRCUIT FLEXIBILITY: All the contacts of its two instantaneous and two 
delayed load ­
switches are externally accessible at a 14 point terminal 
block.
LONGEST LIFE: With an average mechanical life expectancy of over 
5,000,000 ­
operations before the first failure, the 305 is the leader in 
its class.
PILOT LIGHT: A built-in pilot light indicates that the timer is running.
The 305 is a synchronous motor-driven timer with an 
­
electrically-operated clutch equipped either for ON-Delay or OFF-Delay 
operation.
ON-DELAY: When power is applied (start signal on), the clutch solenoid 
is energized. Two things happen immediately and simultaneously, the 
instantaneous switches transfer from one set of contacts to the other, 
and the motor begins to drive the cycle progress pointer toward zero.
At the end of the timed period, the pointer trips one of the delayed 
switches, a brief time later (about 1/2% of full scale), the other delayed 
switch is tripped, stopping the timer motor but leaving the clutch en­
gaged. The timer does not reset until power to the clutch is removed.
OFF-DELAY: Timing starts when power is removed (start signal off), 
from the spring-loaded, normally engaged clutch. The timer is reset 
when power is restored to the clutch solenoid; simultaneously, the 
instantaneous contacts are tripped. Action of the delayed contacts is the 
same as with ON-Delay timers. A power outage stops the motor but does 
not reset the OFF-Delay 305E.

Through advanced circuit design and packaging technology, the ON-
Delay ATC 313 packs all of the performance of a conventional plug-in 
TDR in a space-saving housing. It features a digital timing circuit which 
ensures high repeat accuracy and excellent noise immunity.
MINIATURE HOUSING: You can mount several ATC 313 timers in the 
same space as a single conventional TDR.
DIGITAL ACCURACY: A custom C-MOS integrated circuit accurately 
measures the dial-adjustable delay by counting the output of an internal 
oscillator. Repeat accuracy remains high even with variations in voltage, 
temperature and reset time.
STATUS INDICATORS: Two LEDs clearly indicate the operational status 
of the 313: one is energized when power is applied; the other is off dur­
ing the delay period and on at time-out.
INDUSTRIAL QUALITY: With a load relay capable of switching 7A resis­
tive loads and a C-MOS design that protects components against noise 
and voltage transients, the 313 is built for industrial use.

TIME DELAY RELAYS
314B Series
Plug-In Multi-Range
Off-Delay/Interval
WIRING
The ATC 314 is an economical multi-range solid-state TDR with two models; one 
for off-delay (delay-on-break) and one for interval-on-delay operation. With 
three dial-selected adjustable ranges, it provides any timing period between 
0.035 and 100 SEC with excellent repeat accuracy even with wide changes in 
voltage, temperature and reset time.
OFF-DELAY MODEL: Presuming the AC line is energizing the unit continuously, 
when the start switch is closed the relay energizes, the pilot light goes on and 
the unit resets. Opening the start switch begins the timing cycle. A relaxation 
oscillator runs at a rate determined by the set pot. When the oscillator count is 
equal to the level set by the range switch, a digital count circuit is satisfied and 
the unit times out.
At time out, the timing circuit and relay are de-energized and the pilot light 
goes off. Closing the start switch resets the unit. After a power failure (or on 
first startup) the unit will go to the timed out condition (relay de-energized) 
until the unit is reset by closing the start switch to begin a new cycle.
INTERVAL-ON-DELAY MODEL: Timing begins when the start switch is closed; 
simultaneously the relay is energized and the pilot light goes on. Either a 
momentary/sustained start or a sustained start input can be used (see wiring). 
Reset is accomplished by de-energizing the unit. At time-out, the timing circuit 
and relay are de-energized and the pilot light goes off.

SPECIFICATIONS
ZERO-OHM System is a passive device that interconnects between any 
amplifier and multiple loudspeakers without the concerns of amplifier 
speaker loads, impedance and extremely long cable runs.
This Patented Design eliminates the need for 70V-100V transformer

PARTICULARIDADES
El sistema ZERO-OHM es un dispositivo pasivo que se interconecta 
entre cualquier amplificador y varios altavoces sin las preocupaciones 
de las cargas de los altavoces y amplificador, la impedancia y los cables 
extremadamente largos.
Este diseño patentado elimina la necesidad de productos transformadores 
de 70V-100V.
Se pueden conectar varios altavoces en una conexión paralela a 
impedancias por debajo de un (1) Ohm.
CARACTERÍSTICAS
• Funcionalidad de cero (0) Ohm
• No se requieren transformadores
• Se pueden conectar varios altavoces en paralelo
• Se puede usar cualquier impedancia de altavoz: 2/4/8/16 Ohm
• Distribución de energía uniforme sobre tendidos de cable de larga distancia.
• Respuesta de frecuencia de rango completo
• Relación de fase de salida idéntica con todos los amplificadores de potencia
